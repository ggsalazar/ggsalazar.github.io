                    Massive sapient snake-like creatures with four eyes that use 
                     their <b>Slithering Venom</b> to poison their foes and their 
                     <b>Petrifying Gaze</b> to turn their prey to stone to add to 
                     their menagerie. If a Basilisk’s lower eyes (located immediately
                     beneath their normal eyes) are destroyed, they lose their 
                     <b>Petrifying Gaze</b>. Basilisks are vulnerable to weapons that
                     have been lathered in the tears of a Phoenix.

                    <h4>Lair</h4>
                    Basilisks love to collect prey that they have petrified, taking 
                     them back to their lairs in order to use them as decorations to
                     create macabre menageries comprised of various creatures – 
                     usually Sentients – frozen in horror until they crumble into
                     dust. Because a Basilisk lives in its lair, the area is usually
                     saturated in its venom, causing the damage from its 
                     <b>Slithering Venom</b> to increase to 2d12+4. Basilisks typically
                     make their lairs in large, open caverns, or in cave systems with
                     many interconnecting tunnels.

                     crawled over in the last hour is saturated with its venom, which
                     deals 1d12 +4 poison damage (or 2d12 +4 in its lair) on contact
                     and at the start of the touching creature’s turns.

                    <b>Constrict.</b> The Basilisk uses an action to attempt to 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">grapple</a> a Huge or smaller
                     target; on a success, they deal 4d10 +6 physical damage reduced only by the

                    <b>Swallow.</b> Melee attack, up to 1 Big target, 1/action; the
                     target must make a Fort./Ref. save against the Basilisk’s STR

                     as it swallows them. At the start of each of their turns
                     thereafter, they take 4d6 caustic damage as the Basilisk begins
                     to digest them. If the Basilisk takes <u>></u> 52 damage in a
                     single turn, it immediately vomits all swallowed creatures back
                     up. If the Basilisk dies, any swallowed creatures can use 2
                     actions on their turn to crawl out of it, exiting

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    If the Basilisk is aware that its prey is heading somewhere, it will
                     attempt to cover as much of that area in its venom as it can.
                     Otherwise, it will attempt to lure its prey to its layer, where
                     it knows its venom is more potent.

                    The Behemoth is the true epitome of the Monstrosity: a colossal
                     creature with massive horns, teeth like stalagmites and 
                     stalactites, claws as long as claymores, and a hunger that seems
                     to be insatiable. No one knows its origins or its purpose, but
                     what is known is that this horror is among the greatest 
                     monstrous threats that Sentients know of, and requires a small
                     army just to be taken down. When any town, settlement, or city
                     feels the tremble of its footfalls and the echo of its 
                     cacophonous roar, prayers are uttered, precious belongings are
                     packed, and fighters are kissed goodbye – many for the last time.

                     catch and eat their prey. Their bodies are thin and scrawny,
                     and they cover themselves with various flora to serve as both
                     basic armor and to make themselves appear bigger than they
                     actually are. Their primary preferred weaponry consists of
                     sharpened sticks that they use as spears.

                    A wicked amalgam of three beasts – a lion, a goat, and a snake – the Chimera
                     is a triple threat all by itself. With a ravenous hunger, incredible 
                     strength, and the ability to breathe fire from its lion head, poison
                     from its snake head, and lightning from its goat head, the Chimera is a
                     widely feared monster for good reason.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    The Chimera, the proud and powerful beast that it is, prefers to fight alone,
                     and is not afraid of much due to the versatility of its heads. That being
                     said, the Chimera is not stupid, and will not wander into an obvious trap
                     or let itself be caught unawares, keeping at least one head awake while the 
                     other two sleep or occupied with something else.

                    From the waist up, Gorgons resemble Sentients with incredibly horrible 
                     visages, including a nest of snakes in lieu of hair. From the waist down,
                     they are serpent-like, with long tails that they use to slither around on 
                     the ground with instead of legs. Their likenesses are so horrifyingly ugly
                     that they have the power to petrify any who look upon them, turning them to
                     stone over the course of a few seconds. Because of this power, Gorgons make
                     for popular guardians, including by Sentients who are able to convince them
                     to come into their employ. The statues of their victims make for excellent
                     warning signs against intruders.

                    <h4>Lair</h4>
                    When left to their own devices, Gorgons tend to nest in groups of 2+1d2, as
                     they can only stand seeing so much of each other. Though, like Basilisks,
                     their lairs are decorated with the statues of their victims, Gorgon lairs
                     tend to be more open in their spacing and not as cramped as a Basilisk’s.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Ice Phoenixes typically roost and hunt alone, fighting off invaders with their claws,
                     beak, and of course, their cold breath. Should they successfully slow a creature with 
                     their breath, they will attempt to pick the fighter up, fly to the nearest cliff (or 
                     several dozen meters into the air), and drop the afflicted from a great height. Due
                     to their vulnerability to fire, an Ice Phoenix is 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">terrified</a> of flames and heat sources, and
                     will likely flee outright if it sees fire, especially if it is injured.

                     powerful, ensuring that any adventurer unlucky enough to be fooled into
                     touching them is near-hopelessly stuck. Once its prey is stuck in this way,
                     the Mimic will use its reaction to unfurl its arms and shove its prey into

                     the Mimic will also unfurl its legs, allowing it to flee or fight the 
                     unlucky adventurer’s companions.

                     in the group (if there are any) will also show themselves,

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Acting on knowledge gathered from the Scouts, Sahuagin tribes
                     will send parties of Warriors, led by at least one Warchief
                     depending on the size of the party to attack their target. To
                     give themselves an added advantage, the war party will try to 
                     strike at night or at some other time when their quarry least
                     suspects it. If the war party is split up, Sahuagin Warriors 
                     will try to move in groups of 3-5 if they can. There is typically
                     1 Sahuagin Warchief per group of 10-15 Warriors.

                     acting on intelligence gathered by Sahuagin Scouts. Though 
                     typically Warchiefs prefer to stay back and observe the fight to
                     ensure all is going well, it is not unheard of for them to give
                     into their bloodlust and join the fray themselves, almost always
                     turning it into an outright bloodbath.

                    Swamp Spitters are quadripedal, lizard-like creatures that, as their name
                     suggests, reside in swamps, bogs, and other wetlands. With their ability to
                     hawk caustic bile and their razor-sharp teeth and claws, they are threats
                     at both close and long ranges. When they spit their bile, a pair of fins
                     on the sides of their head flair out, making them appear larger and more
                     terrifying to their prey.
