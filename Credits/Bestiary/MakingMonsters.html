            <h2>Letting Creativity Flow</h2>
            <p>There are a great, great many monsters and creatures presented in this book that
             players are free to use and place into their campaigns as they wish. But what if you 
             have an idea for a monster that isn’t presented here? The solution to this is simple:
             just make a stat block for it yourself! Presented here is a step-by-step method of 
             creating your own creatures in manner akin to those presented here.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 0: Modify an Existing Creature</h2>
            <p>Before dedicating the time and energy necessary to making a creature of your own,
             try to find an existing creature already in this book that is similar to the one you 
             have an idea for, and modify it (in lore, mechanics, or both) to suit your idea. This 
             may prove more fruitful than you think!</p>
             
            <Br>
            
            <h2>Step 1: What is its Name?</h2>
            <p>Every great monster needs a name. Think of a name that properly captures the 
             beast’s essence, its gravitas, the terror (or otherwise) that it should strike in all 
             those that hear it.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 2: What Type of Creature is It?</h2>
            <p>Is this creature a <a href="./Monstrosities.html">Monstrosity</a>,
             <a href="./Beasts.html">Beast</a>, <a href="./Undead.html">Undead</a>, an
             <a href="./Others.html">Other</a>, or something else entirely? Knowing what type of
             creature your monster is is important to knowing its niche in the world and under
             what circumstances your players can/should encounter it.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 3: How Big is It?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s size is important for a multitude of factors. A creature’s size will
             inform you of its Health, its defenses, how much damage it should deal, and the scale of
             its threat.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 4: What are its Ability Scores?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s ability scores convey a great deal of information about it, primarily
             what it is good at and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Additionally, its ability
             scores will inform its defenses and saves. The highest any creature’s ability scores can
             go is 10, though there are exceptions for creatures such as gods and Titans.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 5: How Good are its Defenses?</h2>
            <p>The next step is determining the creature’s DEF/RaDEF scores and its saves: 
             assuming it is wearing Light, Medium, or no Armor, its Dodge score is determined by its
             <a href="../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size Penalty</a> + its DEX score + its AGI score (minimum 0).</p>
            <p>Armor is a bit more difficult, and requires some arbitration, but with
             a solid baseline: a creature’s Armor is dependent on the strength and toughness of its 
             hide and scales, if it has any, as well as its size; it can also wear actual physical 
             armor, increasing its Armor score even more.  Use the following table as a guide.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>Huge</td>
                    <td>0 or 1</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Massive</td>
                    <td>0 or 1</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>25</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Colossal</td>
                    <td>0 or 1</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>18</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>25</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>If a creature has more than one type of natural armor, simply add the two values
             for those types of armor together; for example, if a Large creature has Beast Hide
             and Monster Scale armor, its base Armor value would be 21 (6+15). A creature can have
             only one type of hide and one type of scale.</p>
            <p>A creature's <a href="../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter6.html">saves</a> are determined by its
             ability scores: Fortitude is its STR score + CON score divided by 2, minimum .25;
             Reflex is the creature’s AGI score + DEX score divided by 2, minimum .25; Willpower
             is comprised of the creature's CHA score + either its INT or WIS score divided by 2,
             minimum .25.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 6: How Much Health Does it Have?</h2>
            <p>Much like its Armor score, a creature’s Health is also informed by its size: 
             refer to the following table as a guide.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Size</th>
                    <th>Health Die (Average)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tiny</td>
                    <td>d2 (1.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Small</td>
                    <td>d4 (2.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Medium</td>
                    <td>d6 (3.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Big</td>
                    <td>d8 (4.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Large</td>
                    <td>d10 (5.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Huge</td>
                    <td>d12 (6.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Massive and Colossal</td>
                    <td>d20 (10.5)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>As for determining exactly how much Health a creature has, that is up
             to you to decide, and is ultimately a big factor in how difficult you want the monster 
             to be/how long you want the fight to be, i.e. monsters with more Health will be more
             difficult and make for longer fights. If your creature ends up having an odd amount of
             Health Dice, round its average Health down, so a creature with 3d8 Health should have 13
             average Health; also, don’t forget to multiply its CON score by the number of Health
             Dice used and add that to its average Health, e.g. a creature with a CON score of 2
             and 5 Health Dice will have 10 (2 times 5) added to its average Health. If you want to
             vary a creature’s Health without rolling all of its Health Dice, consider rolling a 
             single Health Die and adding or subtracting that to its average Health depending on 
             whether the result is odd or even, respectively.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 7: What is it Vulnerable/Resistant/Immune To?</h2>
            <p>Depending on a creature’s nature, it may be vulnerable, resistant, or immune to 
             certain damage types or conditions, e.g. Scorched will be immune to burn damage but
             vulnerable to freeze damage, and snakes cannot be knocked prone.</p>
            <p>If a creature is vulnerable or resistant to any conditions, then it has
             disadvantage or advantage respectively on saves against those conditions.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 8: How Fast is It?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s speed is largely determined by its size, but is also modified by its
             AGI score and general body shape: for example, Tiny creatures are able to cover a lot 
             less ground than Large ones, and quadrupeds are much quicker than bipeds. If a creature
             is a quadruped, add 6 meters to its walking speed; aside from that, refer to the 
             following table for determining a creature’s walking speed – remember a creature’s Base
             Movement refers to its speed when its AGI score is 2 and it uses all of its actions to move.</p>
            <table>

                    <td>Colossal</td>
                    <td>40 meters</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Also remember that a creature may be more at home in the water or in 
             the air than on land, in which case the above table applies to their swimming/flying 
             speed rather than their walking speed.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 9: What Skills Does it Have?</h2>
            <p>This step is rather straightforward: whatever you believe your creature is good
             at, give it the appropriate proficiency in the appropriate skill, e.g. a land-based
             creature that is good at swimming should have a Swim proficiency of <u>></u>3.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 10: Does it Have any Special Senses?</h2>
            <p>Some creatures, particularly nocturnal ones or those that have lived in the dark
             for extended periods of time, will develop special senses to help them survive in their
             environment, or they may have these senses as a result of arcane influence: senses like
             infrared vision, blindsense, or something else entirely.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 11: What Language(s) Does it Speak?</h2>
            <p>Many creatures and monsters are able to speak, either physically or 
             telepathically. If your creature can speak, consider what languages it does know,
             or if other creatures simply interpret what it “says” as a language they already 
             know, such as in the case of some of the Others. Remember that Common is a language
             that a creature must be taught.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 12: Where can it be Found?</h2>
            <p>Determined in large part by what type of creature it is – but ultimately by you –
             where a creature is found either in general or by your party specifically is a very 
             important aspect of that creature’s existence; <a href="./Unliving.html">Unliving</a>,
             for example, are almost solely found on the Plane of Life.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 13: Does it Have Passive Abilities?</h2>
            <p>Some creatures have abilities that do not require an action to use or are simply
             always active. One such example of this is the Shark’s Bloodlust feature, which 
             activates immediately upon the Shark tasting blood or dealing final damage to a creature.
             A creature’s passive abilities can heavily impact its difficulty.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 14: What are its Attacks, and How Much do They Hurt?</h2>
            <p>For their attacks, most creatures will likely use their natural weapons, such as
             their claws or teeth. As a creature gets larger, the value of its damage die will 
             generally increase - as shown in the table below - but this is not a hard-and-fast
             rule, as creatures may have varying weapons that deal different amounts of damage
             and bestow different effects.</p>

            <p>When determining how much damage a creature deals, keep the party’s defenses in
             mind: most DEF scores start at around 5-10 and usually increase as PCs gain levels.</p>

            <h2>Step 15: Does it Have Active Abilities?</h2>
            <p>Aside from a creature’s attacks, it is important to consider whether it has any
             other abilities, such as innate elemancy, shapeshifting, or anything else of note.
             All creatures also have access to the actions listed
             <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">here</a>.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 16: What Does it Have on It?</h2>
            <p>Many creatures will have loot on their person, which they usually lose possession
             of when they die or are otherwise defeated. Additionally, many monsters and creatures 
             can be skinned or have other parts that can be scavenged off of their bodies (such as a
             dragon’s scales) to be used as armor materials.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 17: How Difficult is It?</h2>
            <p>Finally, you must determine how much of a challenge your creature is. There are 7
             tiers of difficulty in Twelve Elements, ranging from 0 – 6, that convey a general sense 
             of a beast’s toughness for parties of various levels. The different tiers assume a 
             monster of that tier is being faced by 4 party members of various classes of the same 
             level, and should present a decent challenge to such parties. Use the <a href="../Rulebook/Part4/LevelingUp.html">Tiers 
             table</a> as a guide.</p>
