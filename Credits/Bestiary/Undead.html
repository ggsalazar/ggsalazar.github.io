            <p>Undead are horrible monsters that originate from the Plane of Death, yet are able
             to reproduce and replicate with living Sentients, typically through infection or
             some unnatural conversion process. Undead creatures are called such because of the 
             state of their existence: they are neither living nor dead, yet they function, have
             goals, follow orders, and act on their instincts. Undead are feared by many, and
             not without good reason; the appearance of Undead outside of the Plane of Death is
             almost never a good thing, and bloodshed is almost certain to follow.</p>
            <p>On the Plane of Death, Undead prowl, looking for Specters to consume and destroy 
             for good. Most lower-Tier (and, not coincidentally, lower-INT) Undead, such as
             Zombies and Ghouls, simply roam and aimlessly look for Specters to consume, and on
             their own are no major threat, though packs of them can quickly become a major 
             problem. Higher-Tier/higher-INT Undead, like Vampyres, plot, plan, and scheme their
             way to consuming Specters, and in so doing are usually much more successful and 
             much more feared.</p>
            <!--<p>Since Death and Life oppose each other, and the Life’s mirror is Water, all Undead bear a weakness to
                water, as it burns them like a horribly caustic acid; while fully submerged in water, assume the Undead 
                takes 2d8 final damage at the start and end of each of their turns, and 2d4 while half-submerged.
                Conversely, since Death’s mirror is Fire, all Undead are immune to the burning effects of fire and
                resistant to electricity.</p>   KEEP THIS?-->

                     both strength in number and to move quickly and stealthily. If given the
                     chance - such as when taking foes by surprise - Ghouls prefer to tackle 
                     their prey to give themselves an immediate advantage.

                    An Undead that is unique in the sense that it specifically targets Sentients

                     more and more enraged and/or unhinged due to a combination of loneliness, 
                     unresolved business, spending far too much time on the wrong plane of 
                     existence, or some other cause, they become a Poltergeist, murderous and 
                     outright hostile towards any Sentients that have the misfortune of 
                     encountering them. This change gives them a somewhat new form, one that

                    A very simple Undead that is comprised entirely of just the bones of a

                     mindlessly attack whatever non-Undead they happen to percieve. That being
                     said, if someone or something is leading them or commanding their loyalty,
                     they can be a terrifying force to deal with, as they do not fear death,
                     get tired, or need to sleep, and they eat souls.

                    A Specter, also known as a ghost, is the soul of a Sentient whose physical
                     body has expired. Most of the time, when a Sentient dies, a Reaper quickly
                     retrieves their soul and escorts it to the Plane of Death, where it will
                     eventually be consumed and destroyed by an Undead. Alternatively, some 
                     Specters are able to stick around on the Central Corporeal Plane, typically
                     those with a great emotional connection to an object or location near to
                     where they died.<br>

                     and will not have the <b>Incorporeal</b> feature.

                     weapon and deals more than 20 damage in a single attack with that weapon, 
                     they decapitate the Vampyre. If the Vampyre’s heart is being pierced when
                     this happens, they die instantly; otherwise, the Vampyre can move about as
                     normal, and can reattach their head by holding it back in its proper place
                     for one round (doing so costs an action); if the head is destroyed, a new 
                     one grows after 2 rounds.<br>
                    <b>Punctured Heart.</b> If a creature targets the Vampyre’s heart with a 
                     piercing weapon and deals more than 15 damage in a single attack with that
                     weapon, they pierce the Vampyre through the heart, rendering them

                     minute (after which the weapon is ejected from their heart) or until the

                     the Vampyre is decapitated while in this state, they die instantly.<br>

                     a cloud of mist (see <b>Shapeshifting</b> below) and can only take the Move
                     action; after 1d10 days, they reform into their original form at 1 Health.
                     If they are being pierced through the heart, they go

                     no longer being pierced through the heart, at which point they become mist,
                     or they are decapitated, then they die.<br>
                    <b>Regeneration.</b> The Vampyre regains 1d10 +4 Health at the start of each
                     of their turns while not being pierced through the heart.<br>
                    <b>Shapeshifting.</b> The Vampyre can use an action to become any one of the

                    When a particularly intelligent, wise, or strong-willed Sentient (or an
                     Aetherian) is made into a Vampyre Spawn, they instead become a Major 
                     Vampyre Spawn. This Spawn does have a will of their own, and though they 
                     are usually loyal to the Vampyre that created them, there is enough will in
                     them to allow for a degree of freedom, though to call them sentient would 
                     be misleading. Cases of Major Vampyre Spawns becoming disloyal to their 
                     creator are heard of, but are incredibly rare.<br>
                    Like their creators, Vampyre Spawns Major and Minor feast on the blood of 
                     living Sentients to survive. Additionally, another factor that makes Major
                     Vampyre Spawns unique is that they are able to breed with living Sentients,
                     creating Dhampir.<br>

                     next hour. A creature that succeeds this save is immune to this effect for
                     the next 24 hours.<br>
                    <b>Incorporeal.</b> The Wraith can use an action to become incorporeal,
                     becoming <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">invisible</a> and
                     allowing them to move through solid objects with no difficulty, as well as
                     making them immune to damage.

                     their control for the next 24 hours, at which point the Wraith is forced
                     out. Should the target fail the initial save, they can repeat it at the end
                     of every hour while possessed. A target that succeeds on this save is
                     immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.<br>

                    A Zombie is very similar to a Skeleton in pretty much every sense, except 
                     that it is a walking, rotting corpse instead of bones.<br>
                    <b>Infectious Zombie.</b> An Infectious Zombie has the following addition to
                     their <b>Bite</b> action: A creature who takes final damage from this 
                     attack must succeed on a DR 20 Fortitude save or be afflicted with 
                     Zombification, a disease that leaves them 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> and will cause them
                     to become a Zombie 24 hours after being bitten unless they imbibe a Potion
                     of Cure Disease or an <i>exalted</i> Potion of Healing. A creature reduced
                     to 0 Health in this way immediately dies and rises again in 1d10 minutes as
                     a Zombie.<br>
                    <b>Monstrous Zombie.</b> The Zombie statistics assume the Zombie is that of
                     a Sentient, but this does not always need to be the case. In the case of 
                     monstrous Zombies, it is best to modify the creature’s existing statistics
                     to account for its new lack of life and living flesh.

                    Like Skeletons, Zombies are not intelligent enough to form battle plans
                     or think strategically on their own, and when left to their own devices
                     will mindlessly attack whatever non-Undead they happen to perceive. That
                     being said, if someone or something is leading them or commanding their
                     loyalty, they can be a terrifying force to deal with, as they do not
                     fear death, get tired, or need to sleep, and they eat both flesh and souls.

                    A Runner Zombie is a rotting, decaying corpse that still has good use and 
                     control over its body, and is usually in far better shape than their normal
                     counterparts. Whereas regular Zombies are barely an inconvenience, Runner
                     Zombies can be absolutely terrifying and a real threat, especially in
                     groups.

                    Zombie Runners are obviously not any more cognitively capable than their slower
                     brethren, but they make up for this with their tendency to quickly and brutally
                     overwhelm their prey in sheer force and numbers. When engaging in combat, Runners
                     will almost always attempt to <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">tackle</a>
