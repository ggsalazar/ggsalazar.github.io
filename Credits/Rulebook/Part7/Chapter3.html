            <h2>Concoctions</h2>
            <p>Given here are all of the concoctions within I&A, along with the type
             of Aether required to brew it and the typical cost to buy it; however, it is up to your
             GM to decide how many vials of a given solution a seller has, if any, and whether or not
             it can be bought anywhere else. Unless a concoction’s description says otherwise, it 
             must be drunk or injected in its entirety for its effects to be felt. A single person
             can be under the influence of up to 2 concoctions at once, including concoctions
             with instantaneous durations; if a 3rd one is imbibed, the drinker is 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> for the next minute, at the end of 
             which they immediately spend 4 actions throwing up and take 1d6 true damage. If a
             concoction requires two or more types of Aether, it needs at least 1 pound of each
             type to be brewed. To identify a concoction and its effects requires a successful
             DR 16 Alchemy Supplies or Arcana check, though the GM may wish to modify this DR
             based on the strength and nature of the brew.</p>
            <p>To determine the cost of a concoction, use the following steps as a guide
             (if an NPC is selling the concoction, use the prices given):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Double the cost of the Aether used to brew it;</li>
                <li>Double the cost of the other resources, or double the number of days to gather resources;</li>
                <li>Round that up to the nearest multiple of 10.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This should present a fair price for the concoction, though there may be 
             other factors that modify the price of the brew at the seller’s discussion.</p>

                         split's the imbiber's psyche into two distinct halves, one embodying

                         Sentient, and the other solely comprised of their dishonesty, 
                         selfishness, vices, and complete disregard for the all-around 
                         well-being of others. Half of the time, one psyche takes control of
                         the victim, and during the other half, the other. A <i>strong</i> or
                         stronger Potion of Cure Disease will end the affliction and restore
                         the affected's mind, while a weaker Potion will only stave off the

                        <b>Description.</b> Liquid fire is a reddish-orange liquid that, when 
                         exposed to air, ignites in a flame that is much more difficult to 
                         extinguish than ordinary fire; though water will do the trick, the 
                         subject must be completely engulfed, and other methods of putting the 
                         inferno out are far less effective than normal. A <i>weak</i> Elixir of
                         Liquid Fire behaves much the same as a 
                         <a href="../Part5/Chapter4.html">molotov</a>, with the difference that
                         if a creature takes final damage they have a 100% chance of being lit 
                         on fire, and the final burn damage they take from being lit on fire 
                         increases to 1d8. The damage this Elixir deals increases the stronger
                         the brew is by a factor of 1d6/1d8 per level of strength, e.g. a 
                         <i>strong</i> Elixir of Liquid Fire deals 5d6 damage when ignited and 
                         3d8 final burn damage at the start and end of each of the burning

            <p>Poisons are special in that they are the only concoctions explicitly meant to 
             harm the consumer in one way or another. To combat these effects, the victim must
             make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save, the DR for which varies
             depending on the brew’s strength. For simplicity’s sake, the Fortitude Save DR for
             each strength of poison is given here: <i>Weak</i>: 10; <i>moderate</i>: 20; 
             <i>strong</i>: 30; <i>exalted</i>: 40. The described effects assume the imbiber 
             failed the save; if they succeeded, the poison has no effect, unless they deal
             poison damage, wherein like in all other instances, this damage is reduced by the
             result of the victim's <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save.</p>

            <h2>Enchants</h2>
            <p>Enchants are powerful and usually very helpful items – unless the item in 
             question is cursed, though this is rarely the case (for a list of example curses,
             consult “Relic Curses” <a href="./Chapter4.html">here</a>). An enchant’s 
             description will say its effects, power level, the Aether used to make it, and how
             it changes as its power level increases, if it can.</p>
            <p>All enchants must be attuned to in order for the user to gain their benefits and
             know their capabilities. To attune to an item, the user must spend a number of 
             hours equal to the enchant’s power level squared focusing on and bonding with the
             item in question; the exception to this is artifacts, which take a full day's rest
             to become attuned to. A person can be attuned to up to 3 enchants at a time.
             Unattuning to an enchant takes only an hour, and only one person can be attuned to
             an enchant at a time.</p>
            <p>Because the amount of possible enchanted items is practically infinite,
             it would be impossible and impractical to attempt to list them all; instead, a few 
             items will be given at each power level for each category of enchant to give an
             idea of what each type of item at each power level is like.</p>
            <p>Determining the cost of an enchant is far easier than deciding the cost 
             of a concoction; because so much Aether is used to create them, simply doubling the cost
             of the amount of Aether used to enchant the item provides a decent base to start with, 
             and then the cost can be modified by the power level of the item at the seller’s 
             discretion. Refer to the table below as a guide on modifying an enchant’s cost by power 
             level.</p>

            <h2>Destroying an Enchant</h2>
            <p>Non-<i>artifact</i> enchants are not particularly more durable than regular items,
             unless the nature of their enchantment implies otherwise, such as with certain 
             armors. Should an enchant be broken or damaged, it will continue to function as 
             intended, unless the damage was catastrophic. For <i>artifacts</i>, although they 
             are more difficult to destroy, it is not impossible; to destroy them, there are
             two options: the first is to simply assail the item with overwhelming force and 
             power, such as tossing it in an active volcano, smashing it repeatedly, or assault
             it with a variety of powerful and destructive spells. The second is to first
             disenchant the item, then destroy it as one would normally; the process for this
             is covered in the <a href="./Chapter2.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>

                         Sentient. Depending on the kind of creature, it may require an additional type of 
                         Aether besides what is listed, e.g. a Fae would require Magic, a Scorched would 
                         require Fire, etc. (all Beasts can be made with just the types of Aether given). At
                         the user’s command and using 2 actions, the figurine transforms into a full-size 
                         living version of the creature for 1 minute, during which time it is exceptionally
                         loyal to the user and obeys its commands to the best of its ability; its stats are
                         equal to the creature’s normal stats. It can do this once every 24 hours, starting
                         when it returns back to figurine form. The transformation can end early at the 
                         user’s discretion or if the creature “dies”, though neither reduce the recharge time
                         of the figurine. When the transformation ends, the figurine reappears in the user’s
                         possession. The familiar retains all of its memories from every time it is used.<br>

                         of a Sentient will eventually Awaken, becoming sentient, thinking and feeling for

                         as a flesh golem with just enough intelligence and agency to carry out tasks given
                         to it by its creator. The creature, whether Sentient-shaped or not, has the same 
                         stats as its natural counterparts. Homunculi in the shape of small creatures are 
                         often referred to as familiars, especially when under the ownership of an <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>. 
                         If a Homunculus’ owner dies, it imprints on the next Sentient it sees.<br>
                        A Player-Character can in fact be a Homunculus, though this will not 
                         mechanically change anything, as only Homunculi in the form of a

                        <b>Description.</b> Much like the various gate-creating spells, a 
                         portal allows one to travel from one place to another, including 
                         across planes. To construct a portal that sends one to another plane,
                         Aether of that plane's type must be used and another portal must be
                         constructed (or already exist) on the receiving end that also has the
                         originating plane's Aether type; for example, to construct a portal
                         from the Plane of Fire to the Plane of Magic, the portal on the Plane
                         of Fire must be built with Magic Aether and the portal on the Plane of
                         Magic must be built with Fire Aether (a portal does not need to be 
                         constructed solely of Aether, just have Aether incorporated into the
                         building material). A single portal can be built with multiple types
                         of Aether and link to multiple other portals. For portals that go to
                         the Central Corporeal/Ethereal Plane, any type of Corporeal/Ethereal
                         Aether can be used. Additionally, the same Aetherian must imbue their
                         will into both portals, starting with the portal that matches their 
                         Domain. And finally, portals cannot be always-active, but can be 
                         activated for up to a minute using any trigger of the creator's desire,
                         such as a speaking a specific command word/phrase near the portal, 
                         bringing a specific object close to it, activating a specific sequence

                         a 30x30x30 centimeter space, and allows
                         one to store a bit of their life essence – a piece of their soul –
                         inside it, ensuring their continued existence in the event their 
                         current body dies. A phylactery will not supply a new body for the deceased, but 
                         simply stores their soul for an indefinite time until a new unoccupied body can be
                         supplied (or the phylactery is destroyed), such as a corpse, Homunculus, or <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automaton</a>
                         that has yet to Awaken. An Undead being, such as a Skeleton or Zombie, does not 
                         qualify. In the event a corpse is to be used, it must have died of a cause other 
                         than old age and have no missing vital organs, such as its heart, lungs, or brain;
                         if both of these qualifications have been met, then the power of the phylactery will
                         restore the corpse to 1 Health, healing any mortal wounds. The unoccupied body must
                         be within 3m of the phylactery to be possessed.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Higher Levels.</b> As an <i>artifact</i>, a phylactery can create a... serviceable 
                         new body for the user. This new body forms over the course of 1d12 days, and is 
                         clearly not a normal Sentient body. In short, it has the appearance of being a 
                         half-rotted corpse, and while it will have all the necessary appendages (two arms 
                         and legs, two eyes, etc.), it will also have several chunks of flesh missing, such
                         as exposed bones and sinew, a missing nose, etc. The power of the phylactery keeps 
                         the body alive, but only for so long; over the course of 1d12 months, the new body 
                         decays beyond the point of usability. The user can choose between a body constructed
                         by the phylactery or possessing an unoccupied body.<br>

                        <b>Destroying a phylactery.</b> A phylactery does not follow the ordinary rules for
                         being destroyed. Essentially, a phylactery is the only <i>4th level</i>/<i>artifact</i>
                         enchant that can be destroyed without needing to be disenchanted, and can be 
                         destroyed as though it were a <i>1st</i>/<i>2nd level</i> object. This is because 
                         the power of the phylactery is so extremely funneled into retrieving and containing 
                         the attuned soul – and providing it with a new body – that it leaves relatively very 
                         little power to protect the container itself.
