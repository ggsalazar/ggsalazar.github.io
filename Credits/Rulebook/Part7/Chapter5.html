            <h2>The 15 Planes</h2>
            <p>These rules detail 15 different planes, each described 
             here. When creating a world using this ruleset, consider whether you want to have a
             cosmology similar to this or create something entirely new. Either method is just as 
             acceptable, and you may use or borrow as many of the details presented here as you wish
             for your creation(s). The cosmology of the world of Aethra will be used as an example 
             throughout this chapter.</p>
            <p>Aside from that, it is very important to note how much of the cosmology
             the population of your world knows about, and when and how they learned it; as an 
             example, most educated persons of Aethra know of all of the planes presented below 
             except for the Unknown Plane, but they do not know many details, such as exactly how 
             large they are or what their occupants are like (though most everyone knows the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>
             are hate-filled beings who will slaughter a Sentient as soon as they see them). Those 
             who pursue higher education know some more than the general populous, of course, but 
             there are very few, if any, of those for whom any of the planes hold no secrets; no one
             knows what lies at the bottom of the Plane of Water, for instance, or what happens after
             a Specter’s “second death”, or who or what drives the sun and moon across the sky every
             day and night. Additionally, very few know of the existence of the Unknown Plane
             (though some have theorized about its existence), and any who speak about it or have had
             an encounter with something from it will usually either go insane or be written off as 
             such.</p>
            
            <h2>The Corporeal/Physical Planes</h2>
            <p><b>The Central Corporeal/Physical Plane.</b> The home of all Sentients and 
             Sentient civilizations, the Central Corporeal (or Physical) Plane can be thought of as 
             the “natural” world. Generally, anything that doesn’t belong to or originate from here is 
             referred to as “extranatural”.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Air.</b> Far above the Central Corporeal Plane lies the
             Plane of Air, home of the <a href="../../Bestiary/Ascended.html">Ascended</a>,
             who make games and entertainment out of watching and interacting with Sentients – 
             sometimes to their harm, either physically or otherwise. Bits of floating land do 
             populate this Plane, ranging from a less than a meter in width to several thousand, though these
             are usually hidden from Sentient eyes by arcane means. Additionally, since the Plane of
             Air is so far from the Plane of Gravity, gravity itself is much weaker here – everything
             here weighs about ½ of what it does on the Central Plane. Should a Sentient find 
             themselves lost on the Plane of Air, an <a href="../../Bestiary/Ascended.html">Ascended</a>
             is more likely to drop them and make a game out of how long they take to hit the ground
             than bring them back down safely – unless they can be convinced otherwise.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Earth.</b> Immediately beneath the Central Physical 
             Plane is the Plane of Earth, where <a href="../../Bestiary/Buried.html">Buried</a>
             toil away and forge new metals and minerals out of the rock and soil, shifting it as 
             they go about their work. In so doing, they shape the landmasses of the Central Plane, 
             often moving old mountains or creating new ones – though both of these are extremely 
             long processes, far longer than any Sentient has ever lived. This results in the pushing
             of new minerals, metals, and Aether into the Central Plane through these mountains.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Fire.</b> Underneath the Plane of Earth lies the Plane
             of Fire, home to the burning, hateful, psychotic <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>.
             As the soil and rock in the Plane of Earth shift, this will sometimes place isolated 
             pockets of flame and magma under extreme pressure, which will then force its way out 
             onto the Central Plane and create a fiery eruption, resulting in a volcano – and 
             sometimes an invasion of <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>.
             Because this Plane overlaps with the Plane of Death, some Sentients have come to believe
             that after death there is only fire, flame, and suffering at the hands of raging <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Water.</b> Starting a few hundred kilometers into the 
             Outer Seas and stretching for a countless number of kilometers all around the Central Plane, the Plane
             of Water is home to the <a href="../../Bestiary/Drowned.html">Drowned</a>,
             who are rather impartial to Sentients but have absolutely no qualms about killing them 
             when the need – or desire – arises. Bits of land do pocket the Plane of Water, spanning
             anywhere from a few meters in width to hundreds of kilometers. Should a Sentient
             ship ever become lost at sea and find itself in the Plane of Water, a <a href="../../Bestiary/Drowned.html">Drowned</a>
             is just as likely to guide it back to the Central Plane as it is to kill everyone on 
             board and utterly destroy the ship; often, the only variable in deciding between the two
             is the <a href="../../Bestiary/Drowned.html">Drowned’s</a> mood at that particular moment.</p>
            
            <h2>The Ethereal/Spiritual Planes</h2>
            <p>Mirroring the Corporeal planes are the Ethereal, and every Physical plane has a 
             corresponding mirror. In a sense, the Spiritual and Physical planes overlap, but it would
             be more accurate to say they exist in parallel dimensions right alongside each other. The
             Ethereal Planes experience night during the Corporeal Planes’ day, and experience day 
             while the Corporeal Planes go through the night.</p>
            <p><b>The Central Ethereal/Spiritual Plane.</b> The Central Ethereal 
             Plane mirrors the Central Physical Plane, and though it is not home to any notable 
             Sentients or Sentient civilizations, it is possible (though rare) for Sentients to get
             lost and/or trapped there. The souls of living Sentients are visible on the Central 
             Ethereal Plane, and a creature that can see into this plane sees Sentient souls instead
             of their bodies.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Death.</b> When a Sentient dies, a <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Reaper</a>
             escorts their soul from their expired body to the Plane of Death – unless the soul is 
             tied to a specific object or place for one reason another. Existing opposite the Plane 
             of Fire, the Plane of Death is where Specters roam freely as they wait for what they 
             call the “second death”: a process through which their souls are destroyed and their 
             existence ceases entirely. This second death occurs whenever the soul sustains too much
             damage to continue existing, such as from some sort of arcane source, from a creature 
             like another Specter, or one of the hostile <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a>
             that heavily populate this Plane. Until their second death, souls are functionally 
             immortal and free to do as they wish. In a lot of ways, being dead is much like being 
             alive, and many souls view it as a second life in and of itself – as long as you can 
             avoid being hunted and destroyed by another <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a>.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Gravity.</b> Immediately beneath the Central Spiritual
             Plane and opposite the Plane of Earth lies the Plane of Gravity, pulling everything in 
             towards it and literally holding the world together. Here, the <a href="../../Bestiary/Weightless.html">Weightless</a>
             carefully maintain the forces that do this, and will defend this Plane and those forces
             violently if they feel they are threatened in the slightest. The plane itself exists in
             a perpetual zero-gravity state, allowing beings and objects to move completely freely.
             Since the Planes of Death and Fire are beneath it, gravity on those planes attracts
             things “upward”, towards the Central Planes.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Life.</b> Reflecting the Plane of Water is the Plane of
             Life, a vast, seemingly endless ocean in which the Unliving churn out and create new 
             souls. At the time of a Sentient’s birth or Awakening an <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Unliving</a>
             brings a clean soul to the Central Physical Plane and places it inside of a Sentient’s 
             body, which it bonds to until the Sentient dies or has their soul forcibly removed for
             one reason or another. Like the Plane of Water, pockets of land of varying size do exist
             here. Should a Sentient encounter an <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Unliving</a>,
             they are usually happy to help in any way they are able, and rarely is this not the case.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Magic.</b> Parallel to the Plane of Air exists the 
             Plane of Magic, where the mischievous <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a>
             play and dance with each other, and dream up new ways of messing with Sentients and 
             interfering in their lives, for better or worse. Like the Plane of Air, there are 
             pockets of flying land that the <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a>
             live on, covered in strange vegetation and paradoxical structures that have both been 
             permanently warped by the <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae's</a> 
             mysticism. <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> are unlikely to 
             kill a Sentient should they encounter one; after all, how can you play games with 
             something that is dead? Instead, they are much more likely to capture and enslave it for
             their entertainment, until they grow bored of it, which may be anywhere from a few days
             to the end of the Sentient’s natural life. Just like with the Plane of Air, gravity here
             is about ½ as strong due to this Plane’s distance from the Plane of Gravity.</p>
            
            <h2>The Quintessential Planes</h2>
            <p>Representing the most fundamental elements of the universe, the Quintessential 
             Planes are unique in and of themselves; they are nebulous, they are everywhere and 
             nowhere, they do and don’t exist. In many ways, their inhabitants are the least 
             sentient of all of the various planes’ dwellers, each appearing more akin to common
             beasts on a cursory examination. However, this supposedly simplicity is surface-level 
             only, and in truth, the <a href="../../Bestiary/Darkened.html">Darkened</a>,
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Displaced.html">Displaced</a>, <a href="../../Bestiary/Enlightened.html">Enlightened</a>,
             and <a href="../../Bestiary/Temporary.html">Temporary</a> are possessed
             of some of the greatest insight into the workings of the world as even the most 
             brilliant Sentient.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Dark.</b> The Dark Plane is, as the name would imply, 
             quite dark in nature. So dark, in fact, that it eats at any light inside it – while on 
             the Plane of Dark, light sources, even arcane ones, are only half as strong. And yet, 
             because Dark and Light are inherently intertwined and forever bound to one another, 
             source-less light pervades the Plane of Dark, pocketing it and gently illuminating it 
             in various places. Throughout this plane, the <a href="../../Bestiary/Darkened.html">Darkened</a>
             roam, hunting, playing, living, breeding, and producing the darkness that spans the 
             various corners of the universe. Many Sentients believe that the Moon is the Dark 
             Plane’s physical manifestation.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Light.</b> Bright, pure white light pervades the Plane
             of Light, where <a href="../../Bestiary/Enlightened.html">Enlightened</a>
             roam and perpetuate the creation and proliferation of light into the various corners of
             the universe. Because of its nature, light sources on this plane – even arcane ones – 
             are twice as strong, though they are rarely needed; however, because Dark and Light are
             inherently intertwined and forever bound to one another, shadows are present across the
             Light Plane, pocketing it and darkening it in various places. Many Sentients believe 
             that the Sun is the Light Plane’s physical manifestation.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Space.</b> By far both the most and least material and
             amorphous of all of the planes, the Plane of Space does not have a direct physical 
             manifestation on the planes, and yet, its presence is everywhere – all that has matter
             and physically exists is a manifestation of the Spatial Plane. As for the plane itself,
             its very nature is exactly the opposite of the physical world, with chaotic and 
             indistinct shapeless non-Euclidean forms undulating their way across the entirety of the
             plane, with landmasses as big as continents forming together and breaking apart at 
             random, with incredibly rare constants speckled across the plane. Here, the <a href="../../Bestiary/Displaced.html">Displaced</a>
             thrive in the chaos, and are just as much a part of it as Space itself is a part of the
             Physical and Ethereal Planes.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Time.</b> An endless sea of shifting sands, ticking 
             gears, and flowing rivers, the Plane of Time exists outside of time just as the Plane of
             Space exists outside of space. It is not unusual for travelers of the Time Plane to 
             navigate its strange landscapes for what feels to be years, only to return to their home
             plane to find not a minute has passed; other times, they may be there for only a brief 
             visit, perhaps a day at most, but return home to find a year or more has passed. 
             Scholars heavily debate this plane’s physical manifestation: some say the passage and 
             knowledge of time itself is how it manifests, others say it is the flowing rivers of the
             world, or the movement of a shadow across the ground – all of them and none of them are
             correct. So long as Time continues to flow and move forward and the <a href="../../Bestiary/Temporary.html">Temporary</a> work 
             tirelessly to keep it doing so, the Plane of Time will be present throughout the 
             universe.</p>
            
            <h2>The Unknown Plane</h2>
            <p>Far beyond the furthest reaches of any and all of the planes, there exists 
             something… else. Something alien, eldritch, and unknown, a sort of cosmic soup, older 
             than the gods, from which Creation emerged. Even the gods do not know what lies beyond
             this realm, or where it comes from; on Aethra, the only being to ever traverse it was Ex
             Machina, and they have yet to return from that cosmic abyss. Occasionally, very rarely,
             something… Other, something utterly and entirely alien, will emerge from the Unknown 
             Plane, with unknowable objectives in mind. These beings do not operate by the same
             rules as Iron & Aether, and do not think the same way Sentients or even the gods do. Their 
             goals, methods, and motives are inherently foreign and unknown, and as such it is
             impossible to truly trust anything that comes from this unknowable dimension.</p>
            <p>The Bestiary has several examples of different <a href="../../Bestiary/Others.html">Others</a>,
             as well as descriptions of their abilities and possible motivations, to serve as 
             possible inspiration for any adventures or quests a GM may wish to run that has eldritch
             and/or cosmic elements. There is also the possibility of Other relics, ruins, or 
             dungeons if a GM would like to throw something new and unknown at their players.</p>
