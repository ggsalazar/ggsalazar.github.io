            <h2>What is Aether?</h2>
            <p>Aether is a truly wondrous substance – or rather, a collection of substances with
             powerful and unique properties. It is the manifestation of the twelve elements, 
             and though not used for much, what it is used for is the foundation of the world,
             history, and workings of the world of Aethra (occasionally used as an example
             herein) and the I&A ruleset.</p>
             
            <h2>Types of Aether – The Twelve Elements</h2>
            <p>There are twelve types of Aether in existence, one for each element, and they are 
             all briefly described here. The elements themselves are each grouped into one of 
             three categories, also described here: the Corporeal/Physical, the 
             Ethereal/Spiritual, and the Quintessential.</p>

                    <div class="gridtent">
                    <br>
                        The Corporeal, or Physical, elements are, as the name would imply, those one can 
                         touch and make contact with. They are also the only elements naturally found on the 
                         Corporeal Plane.<br>
                        <b>Air.</b> Air is the element of wind, the breeze, the oxygen 
                         Sentients and many other creatures breathe. Air Aether is light grey.<br>
                        <b>Earth.</b> Earth is the element of stone, metal, and dirt, and
                         it comprises the ground and mountains. Earth Aether is brown.<br>
                        <b>Fire.</b> The element of heat, crackling flame, the flash of 
                         lightning, fire spews and explodes out of volcanoes and fuels many of the Sentients’
                         machines. Fire Aether is red.<br>
                        <b>Water.</b> The element of ice, rain, and the vast oceans, as flame
                         is fuel to machines, water is fuel for the Sentients themselves. Water Aether is blue.

                    <br>
                        The Ethereal, or Spiritual, elements are native to the Ethereal Plane, the mirror and 
                         reverse of the Corporeal. Their nature, like their plane, is the converse of the Corporeal;
                         they cannot be touched or interacted with, but they are there nonetheless and just as, if 
                         not more important. Their powers are strange and their uses varied.<br>
                        <b>Death.</b> All that begins must also end; such is the nature and demand 
                         of Death. Chaotic and wanton in when and how it strikes, but merciful and orderly in the 
                         discipline with which it does so. Death Aether is dark grey.<br>
                        <b>Gravity.</b> All things must be held in place, held down, held together 
                        for the universe to exist. Gravity is the element that takes this role and holds the universe
                        in place and together. Gravity Aether is starry and speckled with points of light of various 
                        colors; otherwise it shifts from light to dark grey.<br>
                        <b>Life.</b> The element that comprises the souls of the Sentients – indeed,
                         the element of Life is what makes them Sentients in the first place. Without this, all of the
                         sentient races would be nothing more than animals operating on pure instinct. Life Aether is a
                         light green that borders on turquoise.<br>
                        <b>Magic.</b> The element of illusions and mysticism, of wonder, lies, and all
                         which is not as it seems. Magic is believed to be the source of all creativity, and who is to say
                         those who believe such are wrong? Magic Aether is purple and glimmers frequently.

                    <br>
                        The Quintessential elements are the fundamental building blocks of all of the planes, and indeed
                         the entire universe. They cannot be physically touched, but they are everywhere all the same, and
                         without them reality would fall apart. Their Aether is exceptionally rare and is more frequently 
                         harvested from Quintessential Aether Storms than anywhere else.<br>
                        <b>Dark.</b> The element of emptiness, silence, the void, and all the secrets that 
                         lie within. Darkness is light’s complement, and without it all would be just as blind as though there
                         were darkness without light. Dark Aether is a deep black.<br>
                        <b>Light.</b> The element of radiance, of hope, of the sun shining through the trees on
                        a beautiful day. Light cannot exist without its counterpart, darkness, as they are co-dependent on each 
                        other to maintain harmony in the universe. Light Aether is a bright white with hints of yellow.<br>
                        <b>Space.</b> The element of all which physically exists and has matter; of the 
                         Quintessential elements, this one is the most literal building block of the universe. Space Aether is 
                         clear and translucent, and appears to shift and obscure the area immediately around and through it.<br>
                        <b>Time.</b> Flowing ever-forward like a river, time ensures everything in the universe
                         keeps moving, progressing, improving, deteriorating; whatever its natural course may be, time ensures 
                         everything will meet its destiny when it is meant to. Time Aether is also clear and translucent, however 
                         everything around it seems to move a bit more quickly or slowly than it should.

            <h2>Aether Storms</h2>
            <p>Aether Storms are, as the name would imply, storms that are fueled by and unleash
             in their fury the powers of a random type Aether. On the Corporeal Plane, a given area 
             will be hit with an Aether Storm of a Corporeal type of Aether (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water)
             usually once every few years, and the same goes for the Ethereal Plane and Ethereal types
             of Aether Storms (Death, Gravity, Life, or Magic). On both Planes, Quintessential Aether 
             Storms (Dark, Light, Space, or Time) strike a given area perhaps once every 15 years.</p>
            <p>On the Corporeal Plane, such storms usually involve the given element
             pouring down like rain, striking the ground like lightning or meteors, strong winds flecked 
             with small chunks of the element howling through the area at high speeds. Ethereal Plane 
             Aether Storms are different: random, semi-frequent bursts of the element pocket the given 
             area for several minutes, wells of the element’s energy may burst out of the ground and 
             shower the surrounding area, or an effect of the given element may manifest in a specific 
             area for a few hours, such as the gravity of a piece of land becoming stronger or weaker, or
             a given area becoming covered in a particularly thick and possibly lethal Death fog. 
             Quintessential Storms are a mix of the two, sometimes favoring one type more than the other,
             but not always.</p>
            <p>These storms last anywhere from 1 – 6 days, and while they can be incredibly
             dangerous, they can also bring great boons: the leftovers of the elements are usually rich with
             Aether, and children born during an Aether Storm have decent chances (about 20% each) of becoming
             <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> or <a href="../Part3/Specials.html">Elementia</a>.
             It is actually not uncommon for a Water Aether Storm to be mistaken for a particularly
             nasty downpour until is over, when some newborn babes are discovered to be <a href="../Part3/Specials.html">Elementia</a>
             or a host of the population comes down with Aether Sickness.</p>
            
            <h2>Forms of Aether</h2>
            <p>All types of Aether can take three forms: solid, which is typically crystalline 
             when pure or ore-like when impure; liquid, which is thin and water-like when pure 
             or thick and sludgy when impure; and gaseous, which is always thick and semi-opaque.
             Pure solid Aether is surprisingly edible, though most who wish to ingest it do 
             prefer to drink it when possible. One pound of solid Aether is roughly half the
             size of an apple.</p>
            <p>To convert solid Aether into liquid, it must be crushed and ground into what 
             would normally be a fine and sprinkle-like dust, but in the case of Aether 
             liquifies and creates a liquid with the same volume as its solid counterpart. To
             convert liquid into gaseous, it must be boiled at a temperature of 100 degrees 
             Alchelite, the same that it takes to boil water; however, gaseous Aether is not hot
             and can be interacted with safely, though breathing it in for a few minutes is
             enough to induce Aether Sickness. Gaseous Aether cannot be converted into liquid,
             but it can be made solid by exposing it to a temperature of 0&#176;A (also the 
             freezing temperature of water).</p>
            <p><b>Alchelite (A).</b> Alchelite is the temperature-measuring metric in I&A. For
             simplicity, it is equal to the real-world metric of Celsius. Sentient body 
             temperature is 37&#176;A.</p>
            
            <h2>Aether Sickness</h2>
            <p>When one consumes or ingests any kind of pure Aether or injects it into their
             bloodstream they become afflicted with Aether Sickness. Every day for the next 
             1d3+1 days, Aether Sickness reduces the afflicted creature’s Health by 20% of their
             maximum, during which time the afflicted is <a href="../Part6/Chapter14.html">sickened</a> 
             and cannot regain any Health by any means. If this disease brings the afflicted’s 
             Health down to 0, they must succeed on a DR 15 Endurance Save or die as the Aether
             consumes them and transforms them into a monster of the corresponding Aether type,
             e.g. Air Aether will create an <a href="../../Bestiary/Ascended.html">Ascended</a>,
             Dark Aether will create a <a href="../../Bestiary/Others.html">Darkened</a>, and so
             on.</p>
            <p> Should an <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a> ingest Aether in any
             way, if the Aether is not of the type that they have already bonded to, they will 
             invariably be riddled with Aether Sickness for the next day or two, during which 
             time they will intermittently vomit up the Aether they consumed in solid and/or
             liquid form. If it is of the type they have bonded with, then their Mana is 
             restored by an amount equal to 10 times the number of pounds of Aether that they
             consumed.</p>
            
            <h2>Where to Find It</h2>
            <p>Different types of Aether are found in different places. As stated above,
             Corporeal and Ethereal Aethers are almost exclusively found on their respective 
             planes, and Quintessential Aethers are exceedingly rare everywhere but their own
             planes. Very occasionally a type of non-native Aether will crop up on the opposite
             plane (such as a life spring in the Central Physical Plane or a volcano on the
             Central Ethereal Plane), and the rarity of these instances is up to your GM.</p>
            <p>Given here is the most common place to find each type of Aether on the Central
             Corporeal and Ethereal Planes – it can be assumed that each element’s plane has 
             ample amounts of the appropriate type of Aether.</p>
            <p><b>Air.</b> Air Aether is found in the centers of clouds, usually in gaseous form.</p>
            <p><b>Earth.</b> Earth Aether is found deep in mountains, alongside and deeper in 
             than other minerals that also grow out of the Earth Plane with the rest of the
             mountain.</p>
            <p><b>Fire.</b> Fire Aether is found inside volcanoes, both active and inactive, 
             though active volcanoes’ Aether is more pure.</p>
            <p><b>Water.</b> Water Aether is largely found in the deepest parts of oceans and
             large lakes, in both solid and liquid forms.</p>
            <p><b>Death.</b> Death Aether is found in Death Fog, a type of creeping fog that 
             rolls across the Central Ethereal Plane, travelling slowly across the lands. There
             is not one Death Fog, but several, and they range from a few to several 
             hundred meters across, and are constantly growing or dissipating at random. Despite
             its name, it is not necessarily deadly, though it is extremely thick, and those who
             do not wish to endure Aether Sickness must avoid it or protect themselves.</p>
            <p><b>Gravity.</b> Gravity Aether, like Dark Aether, falls occasionally from the sky,
             or like Earth Aether, may grow out of the ground in rare instances.</p>
            <p><b>Life.</b> Life Aether is found in life springs; such springs are uncommon even
             on the Spiritual Plane, as their healing properties are exceptionally powerful and
             the stuff of legend. Only one or two exist on Aethra's Corporeal Plane and are
             referred to in legends as Fountains of Life.</p>
            <p><b>Magic.</b> Magic Aether grows in large chunks of varying size and purity out 
             of the ground; such areas where they are found are referred to as Crystal Gardens 
             or Magic Gardens. Often in these Gardens, a single large (roughly 3x3x3 meters) 
             chunk will grow, and then several other, small crystals will grow around it,
             sometimes seemingly randomly, sometimes in very specific shapes and patterns. These
             Gardens usually cover 5-10 square meters.</p>
            <p><b>Dark.</b> Chunks of Dark Aether – colloquially referred to as Pieces of Night
             – have been known to occasionally fall from the night sky in meteor-like rocks;
             however, such occurrences are exceptionally rare, happening in the world of Aethra 
             perhaps once or twice a year. Each Piece of Night gives about 300 lbs. of Aether.</p>
            <p><b>Light.</b> In a similar manner to Dark Aether, chunks of Light Aether – known
             to many as Pieces of Sun – occasionally fall from the sun in meteor-like rocks. 
             Also like with Dark Aether, this is incredibly rare and happens only once or twice
             a year on either plane. Each Piece of Sun gives about 300 lbs. of Aether.</p>
            <p><b>Space.</b> Space Aether is an interesting case; the only commonality in where
             and how it appears is that it grows, in pure solid form, from whatever spot it has
             decided to grow from. Sometimes this leads to a massive Space Aether crystal being
             found growing in the wilds, or a small chunk of it growing out of the side of a 
             house. Like Dark and Light, instances of Space Aether being found are exceedingly
             rare.</p>
            <p><b>Time.</b> Time Aether appears randomly in much the same manner Space Aether
             does, with one key difference – it appears in liquid form in fluids, slowly 
             spreading and converting the entire body into Time Aether. This can only occur in 
             bodies of water that are not physically connected to the Plane of Water.</p>
            
            <h2>Where to Buy It</h2>
            <p>In the world of Aethra, the acquisition and distribution of Aether is typically 
             handled by whoever discovered it, or whoever is in control of a given source at any 
             given time. This may be the local government, a rich merchant, or some farmer who 
             discovered Aether growing in their crops. Each of these distributors may charge 
             different prices for the Aether in their possession, and at that point it is up to the

            <h2>What it is Used For</h2>
            <p>Aether is a mysterious and powerful substance, and though its uses are actually 
             quite limited, what it is used for is fundamental for Sentient societies, 
             civilizations, and cultures.</p>
            <p>Aether’s most basic and fundamental use is the creation of <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a>. 
             Aside from that, the primary use of Aether is in <a href="./Chapter2.html">alchemy</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Air.</b> Air Aether is used for the enchanting and brewing of items 
             and concoctions that bestow flight, the ability to breathe safely (such as in poisonous 
             gas or underwater), and increasing one’s AGI and DEX.</p>
            <p><b>Earth.</b> Earth Aether is used for concoctions and enchants of strength,
             durability, and protection.</p>
            <p><b>Fire.</b> Fire Aether is used in the strongest explosives, concoctions of
             unbridled rage and fury, and flame and lightning-based enchanted items.</p>
            <p><b>Water.</b> Water Aether is used in the brewing of concoctions that help one
             swim, as well as water and ice-manipulating enchants.</p>
            <p><b>Death.</b> Death Aether is, unsurprisingly, very popular in the brewing and 
             creation of the strongest poisons and poisonous enchants. It is possible to brew poison without
             Death Aether, but the strongest and most deadly poisons use it.</p>
            <p><b>Gravity.</b> Gravity Aether doesn’t find much use in concoctions, but it does
             find use in enchants that require weight manipulation or freely-applied magnetism.</p>
            <p><b>Life.</b> Life Aether’s most common and popular use is in healing potions and 
             elixirs of curing and relieving diseases. Life Aether is also needed for the creation of new 
             <a href="../Part3/Specials.html">Automata</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Magic.</b> Magic Aether is very useful in the creation of deceitful, 
             double-natured enchants and hallucinogenic poisons.</p>
            <p><b>Dark.</b> Dark Aether is used to brew concoctions and enchant items that create
             darkness, cause silence, and curse with blindness.</p>
            <p><b>Light.</b> Light’s most common use is for the creation of light-emitting enchants
             and particularly effective truth serums.</p>
            <p><b>Space.</b> Space Aether is used in the creation of transmutation and creation 
             enchants.</p>
            <p><b>Time.</b> Used in the creation of hasting and slowing concoctions, as well as 
             time-manipulating enchanted items. Also used to create exceptionally accurate clocks and seasonal 
             calendars.</p>
            
            <h2>Aether Effects on Non-Sentients</h2>
            <p>When ingested by a non-Sentient creature such as a Beast, the Aether will corrupt
             their body and turn them into a monster of the corresponding Aether type, e.g. consuming
             Fire Aether will create a <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>,
             Death Aether will create an <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a>, etc.</p>
