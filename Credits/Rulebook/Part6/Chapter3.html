            <p>There are many, many circumstances under which a character may become somehow 
             impaired, such as losing their sight or ability to move, or gaining an awful feeling in
             their body or mind that makes performing actions more difficult. Listed and described
             here are several such conditions and their effects on a creature. Several conditions 
             refer to another condition in their description; in such cases, the effects stack with
             each other.</p>
