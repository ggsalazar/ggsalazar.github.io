            <h2>Time to Unwind</h2>
            <p>Downtime is an important part of adventuring. Characters can use their free time 
             to heal and recover from wounds (both physical and mental), craft equipment, brew 
             concoctions, gather information, or simply carouse to their heart’s content. These 
             things may go as planned, or complications and obstacles can arise. Given here are a 
             list of sample activities and how they may turn out, from making money to making 
             enemies. Each of the activities presented can be performed over the course of a 
             day’s rest, and the tables for each activity assume the entire day has been spent
             doing that activity.</p>

                        If a party member knows how to perform <a href="../Part7/Chapter2.html">alchemy</a>,
                         they can use their downtime to brew concoctions or enchant items, provided they have
                         the proper funds, time, and materials.

                        Carousing is an umbrella term that refers to any hedonistic and/or pleasurable 
                         activities that do not (usually) produce any material results or actively work 
                         towards any of the party’s goals. You can pick from the following list, roll, or
                         come up with your own activity to decide which your character does with their free
                         time. The Cost list determines how much money your character lost in doing their
                         chosen activity. Both of these lists assume only one day has passed, but that does
                         not necessarily need to be the case. The last table need only be rolled on once, to
                         determine what consequence, if any, your carousing has had on your life.<br>

                        Sometimes, the best way to pass the time is with a good heist. Burning down a 
                         rival’s safehouse, robbing some greedy merchant blind, or perhaps assassinating a
                         troublesome official – nothing pays quite like crime, does it? Given here is a list
                         of sample crimes that you can do during your downtime, as well as a possible 
                         punishment if you are caught or reward if you succeed. Each table assumes your 
                         crime takes only a day, however if a major crime or heist is part of your group’s
                         campaign or something they decide to spend their downtime on collectively, it is 
                         recommended you roleplay the heist and take the time to make detailed and dedicated
                         plans amongst yourselves, as that is part of your group’s story and not something 
                         your character is doing on their own to pass the time.<br>

                        Training allows a character to increase their proficiency with any skill of their
                         choice. For proficiency in a skill to increase by 1, a character must spend
                         15 days and 15d3 Aeons (1d3/day) training that skill, assuming you are paying 
                         someone who is better in that skill to train you; a person with a higher proficiency
                         in the given skill can also train you, and it is up to them if they want you to pay
                         them or not. The time and money spent does not all need to be done at once, but if
                         the time training is broken up, you and/or your GM must be careful to keep track of
                         the amount of time you’ve dedicated to your training.<br>
                        A character can also train without spending money (i.e. on their own), though this takes 
                         twice as long.

                        Some characters may wish to work their time away doing odd jobs, and in so doing 
                         earn some pocket cash. Given here is a list of sample work activities that your 
                         character can spend the day doing, as well as a table of their possible earnings. 
                         You can roll or pick from the first table or make up your own activity, but you must
                         roll on the second table and add your CHA score.<br>
