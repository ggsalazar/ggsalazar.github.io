            <center><h1>Chapter 6: Brightness</h1></center>
            <p>In I&A, there are 3 levels of brightness: bright light, dim light, and
             darkness. Each affects how characters perceive the world around them, which is 
             mechanically represented by how they affect Perception checks and combat. The effects of
             each level of brightness are detailed below.</p>
            <p><b>Bright Light.</b> In bright light, characters can see everything 
             perfectly well, and have no penalties to Perception checks or attack rolls unless 
             otherwise stated.</p>
            <p><b>Dim Light.</b> Dim light causes Perception checks to be made with 
             disadvantage, however attacks are made as normal.</p>
            <p><b>Darkness.</b> In darkness, a character is considered <a href="./Chapter3.html">blinded</a>, 
             and remains that way until they enter an area that is at least dimly lit.</p>
            
            <h2>Infrared Vision</h2>
            <p>If a character has infrared vision, they can use 4 actions at any time to change
             their vision from normal (light-based) sight to infrared (heat-based) sight. What this
             means is that that creature can see the amount of heat anything in their visual range
             gives off, such as a creatureâ€™s body heat or the heat of footprints left behind on a 
             cold surface. It is important to note that certain surfaces and materials (such as fog
             and glass) are opaque in the infrared spectrum.</p>
            <p>Usually, this will allow them to see with relative ease in dim light or
             darkness, but not always; if everything in their environment gives off the exact same 
             amount of heat, then this will not help them very much. Additionally, they cannot 
             perceive natural color while seeing in the infrared spectrum, which may work to their
             disadvantage depending on the situation.</p>
            <p>In bright light, depending on the source of the light (such as the sun
             or an intense flame), the creature may be <a href="./Chapter3.html">blinded</a>
             while facing the source of the light, as the heat of the light overwhelms their infrared 
             perceptions; if the source of the light gives off little or no heat, then this is not an
             issue.</p>
             
            <h2>Darkvision</h2>
            <p>A creature with darkvision perceives natural darkness as dim light, and natural dim
             light as bright light.</p>
            <p>A creature with arcane darkvision perceives both natural and arcane darkness and
             dim light as bright light.</p>
