            <p>Characters are able to perform a variety of actions as they explore and interact
             with the world during their adventures. These actions can be performed in or out of 
             combat, and many can be performed as reactions.</p>
            <p>During each round of combat, a creature can perform up to a number of actions on their turn 
             determined by their <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">DEX score</a> and 1 reaction during any
             other creature’s turn. Certain 
             class features, spells, enchanted items, or other special circumstances may grant a 
             creature more actions or reactions.</p>
             
            <h2>Holding Actions</h2>
            <p>If a creature so desires, instead of using all of their actions on their turn, they can
             instead hold up to two of their actions while they wait for a specific trigger, which they
             must state at the time they decide to hold these actions; if this trigger occurs, they then
             use their reaction to perform their held actions; if it doesn't, they lose those actions, but
             can use their reaction for something else if they desire.</p>

                        When a creature takes this action, they are choosing to attack a creature, character,
                         or object within range using their currently equipped weaponry, their spells, or 
                         whatever else they may wish to use. When making an attack with a weapon, unless the 
                         weapon has the “DEX” property, add your STR score to the roll.<br>
                        <br>
                        Typically, attacking once requires the use of a single action, however there are
                         some weapons that require more than 1 action to be used effectively. If you do
                         not have enough actions at your disposal to effectively attack with this weapon,
                         you can use the rest of your remaining actions to attack with it once with disadvantage.

                        To blind a creature, the blinder must make a DEX check

                        Whatever weapons a character has in their equipment slots at any given point are
                         their equipped weapons, and they can attack with only those weapons unless they

                        To disarm a creature, the disarmer must make a Sleight of Hand

                         to disarm. On a success, the weapon is plucked out of their hand and thrown 1d3 
                         meters away in a direction of the disarmer’s choosing. The weapon can be caught by
                         you or another person in the weapon’s path with a successful DR 15 Sleight of Hand
                         check, provided the being attempting to catch it has an empty hand and their reaction.

                        A creature disengages when they wish to leave the melee range
                         of all opponents they are currently in melee range of without provoking any 
                         opportunity attacks. If they enter a new opponent’s melee range, they must

                        Evading is a being’s way of preparing for an incoming attack or harmful effect and 
                         bracing themselves against it. When a creature evades,
                         their Dodge score is doubled and all attacks and damage-dealing effects have
                         disadvantage against them until the start of their next turn; they also have
                         advantage on all <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Reflex saves</a> for the same
                         period.

                        When choosing to grapple another creature, the grappler must make a STR

                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Reflex save</a> of the target. On a

                        The Hide action is used when a creature wishes to avoid being spotted by another 
                         entity. In order to hide, a creature needs something to
                         hide behind/in and must make a
                         Stealth check contested by the searching party’s Perception check.

                        Your maximum jump height in meters is equivalent to 1/3 your STR score,

                         running start, it becomes your full STR score. A running start requires a 
                         character to run uninterrupted for at least 4m in a straight line
                         before the jump.

                        This is arguably the most loosely-definable action, since it can apply to almost 
                         infinitely different situations. This action is used when a creature wishes to interact
                         with their environment in such a way that is not otherwise described here; examples 
                         include propping a chair up against a door, flipping a table over to use it as cover,
                         or smashing through a glass pane. It is up to the GM whether the action a creature 
                         wishes to improvise is doable and, if it is, how difficult it is and how many actions
                         it takes to do.

                         at most. The amount of movement at your disposal is determined

                        <br>
                        The amount of movement a creature has assumes they are dedicating their entire
                         turn to moving; to determine how much you can move using an action, simply divide
                         your movement by the number of actions you have. For example, a creature with 24
                         meters of movement and 4 actions could use just 1 action to move up to 6 meters, 
                         allowing them to use their remaining actions for something else.<br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, it is important to note that when you decide to use an action to move, the
                         movement does not all need to be used at once and can be broken up; you could, for instance,
                         use a single action to move 3 meters, use another to attack once, and then move another
                         3 meters without expending another action.

                        <br>
                        Using almost any weapon and/or appropriate item, a creature can pin
                         another to a surface, usually by impaling their clothes to that surface
                         or weighing them down with something heavy. When a creature takes this
                         action, they must make a STR/DEX check contested against the target’s
                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude/Reflex</a> save (determined
                         by what check the pinner is making): if the pinner wins the contest, 
                         the target is considered <a href="./Chapter13.html">grappled</a> by
                         whatever is pinning them, and can take 2 actions on their next turn to
                         make a STR/DEX check to free themselves. The DR for this check is the 
                         result of the pinner’s original STR/DEX check.<br>
                        <br>
                        The action cost to do this varies depending on what is being used: if
                         using a weapon, the action cost is the same as the weapon, and if using
                         an item found in the immediate environment, the action cost is 2.

                        To shove a creature, make a STR check contested against their attempted

                         on a success, they are shoved a number of meters equal to twice the
                         shover’s STR score (minimum 1) in a direction of their choice.
