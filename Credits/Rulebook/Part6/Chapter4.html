            <h2>Going Unconscious</h2>
            <p>When a PC's Health reaches 0, they do not immediately die, but instead go 
             <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> and begin the process of Enduring. During this time,
             on each of their turns, they must make either a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude
             or Willpower save</a>.
             This save has an initial DR of 5, and every time they succeed on it, the DR increases by 5
             until it reaches 20, unless they are stabilized, healed for any amount, or they fail twice. A
             character that succeeds on this save when the DR is <u>></u>20 is stabilized unless they have
             been hit.</p>
            <p>If a character begins the process of Enduring outside of combat, or 
             combat ends while the character is still Enduring, the character must make this save once every
             real-life minute, though this can be adjusted as the GM sees fit. The DR for this save for a
             particular character is retained until that character has a night's or day's rest, at
             which point it resets to 5.</p>
            
            <h2>Being Hit While Enduring</h2>
            <p>The first time a character is hit by anything while they are Enduring, they gain a single
             failure, the DR for their save jumps to 20 or increases by 5 (whichever is greater), and the 
             character must immediately succeed on the save at the new DR; additionally, they can no longer 
             be stabilized without external help, and the DR for this save continues to increase by 5 every
             time they succeed on it. If they
             are hit while Enduring again, or if they already failed the save once, they gain a second
             failure. Lastly, if a single attack would deal enough damage to a character to bring them to 
             negative half of their full Health, then that character dies outright.</p>
            
            <h2>Being Stabilized or Healed</h2>
            <p>When a character is stabilized, they remain <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> at 0
             Health until they receive any amount of healing, or 1 in-game hour passes, at which point they
             regain 1 Health. They do not need to keep making saves during this time. While a 
             creature is Enduring, another character can attempt to stabilize them by making a 
             Medicine Kit check with a DR equal to the current DR of the saves they are making; doing this 
             expends the medicine kit regardless of success or failure. On a success, the character is 
             stabilized, and on a failure, the save DR increases by 5. A 
             character that succeeds on this save while the DR is <u>></u>20 is stabilized unless they
             have been hit. If at any point during the process of Enduring a character is healed by any 
             amount, they are restored to consciousness with the amount of Health that they were 
             healed for.</p>
            
            <h2>Failing</h2>
            <p>Failing the required save twice can mean either one of two things, depending on the 
             exact situation and the GMâ€™s discretion: the first is that the character goes 
             completely <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> and remains that way for the next 8 hours,
             at which point they regain 1 Health; the second possibility is that the character dies.</p>
