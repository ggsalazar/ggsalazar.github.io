            <h2>Weather Effects</h2>
            <p>Weather has an especially interesting influence on the life of those affected by 
             it, especially for travelers, which adventurers frequently are. Given here is a list of
             various weathers, followed by a brief description that includes how it affects the 
             immediate environment. Aether Storms are covered <a href="../Part7/Chapter1.html">here</a>.</p>

                        In clear weather terrain is normal and everything is relatively easy to see.

                    <br>
                        Extreme cold bites through straight to the bone, freezing a creature’s
                         blood in their veins and granting them a cruel and macabre death. While
                         in extreme cold, a creature takes final freeze damage every hour 
                         depending on their state of dress: if they are wearing no or light 
                         clothes, they take an amount of freeze damage equal to 40% of their 
                         maximum Health; if they are wearing Light armor, they take 30% of their;
                         max as freeze damage; with Medium armor, they take 20%; and in Heavy
                         armor and heavy clothing, they take 10%. If wet flesh makes contact
                         with extremely cold metal, the flesh becomes stuck to the metal until
                         either a. the metal is warmed up enough for the flesh to become unstuck
                         or b. the flesh is ripped off, dealing anywhere between 1 and 1d6 true
                         damage depending on how much flesh was stuck.

                    <br>
                        Should a creature be traveling through an area of intense and extreme
                         heat, they will take final burn damage every hour depending on what 
                         they are wearing: if they are wearing nothing or light clothes, they 
                         take an amount of burn damage equal to 10% of their maximum Health; if
                         they are wearing Light armor, they take 20% of their max as burn damage;
                         for Medium armor and heavy clothing, they take 30%; and for Heavy armor,
                         they take 40%. If a creature is taking steps to help cool themselves 
                         off, such as wearing reflective clothing or constantly drinking water,
                         they take the next lowest tier of.

                        During lightning storms, any hearing-based Perception checks are made with 
                         disadvantage, and visibility is reduced to just a couple miles. Should a creature be
                         struck by lightning, they take 4d6 final electric damage.

                        Rain causes everything in the immediate environment to be slick, creating 
                         difficult terrain – whether it be slippery cobblestones, sloppy and thick mud, or
                         slick and slushy snow and ice. It also lowers visibility to just a mile and douses
                         all unprotected and non-arcane Small or smaller flames. Depending on the severity of
                         the rain, Perception checks may be made normally, with disadvantage, or may 
                         automatically fail as appropriate.

                        Similar to rain, snow creates difficult terrain in the affected area as everything
                         becomes covered in snow and ice. Depending on the severity of the snow, visibility 
                         may be reduced to a few kilometers/couple miles or just a few meters/feet, and Perception
                         checks are made normally, with disadvantage, or automatically fail as 
                         appropriate. All unprotected and non-arcane Small or smaller flames are
                         doused.

                        Storms of all kinds severely impede movement, causing all movement to
                         take twice as long as it otherwise would, and reducing visibility to a
                         kilometer/half a mile at best and just a few meters/feet at worst.
                         Medium or smaller unprotected and non-arcane flames are doused, and all
                         ranged attacks and Perception checks on targets <u>&#60;</u> 9m/30ft
                         away are made with disadvantage; ranged attacks and Perception checks
                         on targets > 9m/30ft away automatically fail.

                    <br>
                        Wind causes all Tiny unprotected and non-arcane flames to be doused immediately 
                         and causes all ranged attacks to be made with disadvantage. Visibility and terrain
                         are unaffected, but hearing-based Perception checks are made with disadvantage.
