            <h2>Traveling on Foot</h2>
            <p>When traveling on foot, unless the group encounters difficult terrain and does not
             get lost, they can travel at a slow, moderate, or fast pace for usually 10 hours, with 
             4 hours for making/breaking camp, 2 hours for breaks, and 6-8 hours for a night’s rest 
             that the party takes to recuperate via mostly sleeping, eating, and tending to their 
             equipment. The advantages and disadvantages for traveling at each speed are detailed 
             below.</p>
            <p>While traveling, the party can make the following checks as they feel
             necessary: Navigate checks to keep from getting lost and find their way (mandatory),
             Perceive checks to spot hostile creatures and avoid being surprised, Stealth checks 
             to cover their tracks to avoid being followed, and Survival checks to follow their 
             quarry, if they have one. However, their traveling speed will alter how they make these
             checks, as shown in the table below. Regarding Navigate checks, refer to “Navigating”
             below.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Pace</th>
                    <th>Speed</th>
                    <th>Skill Checks</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Slow</td>
                    <td>3kmph</td>
                    <td>Advantage</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Moderate</td>
                    <td>6kmph</td>
                    <td>Normal</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fast</td>
                    <td>12kmph</td>
                    <td>Disadvantage</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>It should be noted that making/breaking camp, breaks, and night’s rests
             can be skipped in favor of traveling further, but every character that chooses to do so
             has their maximum Health reduced by 25% for every night’s rest that they skip until it
             reaches 1 or they rest again, e.g. a character that travels for 2 days without resting
             has their maximum Health reduced by 50% until they rest again. For every night’s rest a
             character takes, their maximum Health is replenished by 25%, and a day’s rest will 
             restore their maximum Health to full.</p>
            
            <h2>Traveling in Armor</h2>
            <p>Traveling, especially on foot, is an exhaustive activity. For this reason, 
             traveling in heavier armor will exhaust characters far faster than traveling in 
             lighter armor. While traveling on foot in Medium/Heavy armor, a character takes 
             fatigue damage equal to 5%/10% of their maximum Health (rounded appropriately, up
             if half) for every hour that they travel while wearing it.</p>
            
            <h2>Traveling on a Mount or Vehicle</h2>
            <p>When characters travel for several miles – and likely days – they have a 
             multitude of options at their disposal to do so more quickly and usually more 
             safely than on foot. Generally, mounts and vehicles are much safer and faster 
             than on-foot travel, and allow one to carry many more goods and supplies, 
             including weapons to fend off any unexpected threats or supplies to circumvent
             obstacles that may arise. The speed and carrying capacity of various mounts and 
             vehicles are given <a href="../Part5/Chapter5.html">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Traveling Complications and Obstacles</h2>
            <p>Given here is a list of sample traveling complications that the party can 
             encounter as they travel. Should your party come upon a combat or exploration
             encounter, those are detailed in the <a href="./Chapter15.html">here</a>. 
             Otherwise, the complication will be below. The GM should roll on the following
             list once every traveling day, though they can roll more or less frequently at
             their discretion or simply pick and choose what the party encounters as they
             please.</p>

            <h2>Navigating</h2>
            <p>At the start of every travelling day, one member of the travelling party must
             perform a DR 15 Navigation check to properly find their way forward; they must also 
             perform this check whenever they circumvent or overcome a complication, including 
             possibly becoming lost. The DR for this check increases by 5 if one of two conditions 
             are met, or by 10 if both conditions are met: 1. the current <a href="./Chapter7.html">weather</a>
             hampers sight-based Perception checks and 2. the party made camp/the check in difficult
             terrain. If this check fails, the party becomes lost, and travels in a random direction
             of the GM’s choosing (roll 1d8: 1 for North, 2 for Northeast, etc.) for 1d6 hours; at 
             the end of this time, they can make another Navigation check to realize their mistake 
             and right their course, otherwise they remain lost.</p>
            <p>If the navigating party member has a map that covers the area they are
             in, they can add the Navigation bonus of the map, which is equal to half the result of 
             the mapmaker’s Cartography Tools check that they made when they created the map. 
             Additionally, if the navigator has a compass on them – which is included with a set of
             navigation tools – then they have advantage on the check. If the navigator has a full
             set of navigation tools, they still have advantage and can add half the result of a check
             with those tools to their Navigation check.</p>
            
            <h2>Food and Water</h2>
            <p>Creatures need to eat food and drink water to survive; however, how much they need
             to eat and drink varies based on the size of the creature. In the wilds, characters can
             make Survival checks to hunt and gather for their and their allies’ food and water.
             Refer to the following table to determine how much a given creature needs to eat and 
             drink on a daily basis to survive. If a character does not get the necessary amount of
             food and water each day, they suffer the same effects as having not rested for that day 
             (with the difference that they will die if their maximum Health reaches 0%).</p>

            <p>During rests, a character must make 2 Survival checks (one for food and
             one for water) to determine the amount of food and water, in pounds and gallons 
             respectively, that they find: during a night’s rest, the amount of each found is equal
             to ¼ the result of each check; during a day’s rest, the amount of each found is equal to
             the whole result of the check.</p>
