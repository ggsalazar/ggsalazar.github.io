            <p>During their tenure as dungeon delvers and monster hunters, it is not uncommon for
             adventurers to retain serious and permanent – or at least long-lasting – injuries. Such
             injuries can be caused by any one of the following or something else entirely, at the 
             GM’s discretion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>badly failing <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude or Reflex saves</a>;</li>
                <li>losing more than half your Health in a single blow;</li>
                <li>close brushes with death, such as <a href="./Chapter4.html">Enduring</a> or dying and being 
                 resurrected/resuscitated;</li>
                <li>being maimed, especially while <a href="./Chapter3.html">restrained</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The difference between a normal injury and a lingering one is just that: a lingering 
             injury lingers and handicaps the victim in some way. If a character suffers a lingering
             injury, that should impact their abilities somehow, such as disadvantage on certain
             checks, a reduced walking speed, or some other detriment. A lingering injury can be 
             cured by certain healing spells or special potions, such as <i>exalted</i> Potions of 
             Healing.<br>
            <p>Given here is a list of sample lingering injuries and the negative 
             effects they have. When a character suffers such an injury, the GM can use this table or
             come up with their own.</p>
