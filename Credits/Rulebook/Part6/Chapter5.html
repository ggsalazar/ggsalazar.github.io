            <h2>The Start of a Fight</h2>
            <p>Combat begins when the PCs and a group of hostile creatures and/or NPCs abandon 
             diplomacy and decide to settle their problems with violence, though that is not to say
             things cannot still be settled peacefully. This chapter details the general flow and 
             order of over-arching events in combat, as well as laying down a few general ground 
             rules that should help things flow more smoothly.</p>
            
            <h2>Rolling Initiative</h2>
            <p>At the start of combat, every combatant must roll initiative to determine the order in which
             each of them takes their actions. To roll initiative for a creature, simply make a Reflex save
             for them, then report that number to the GM, who will organize the results of each
             combatant's initiative in descending order (i.e. from highest to lowest). If the party is facing
             a large number of hostiles, enemies may be grouped together and act on the same turn to make
             combat logistically simpler – in this case, use the Reflex of the creature with the highest 
             Reflex score. Each creature/group of creatures in combat takes their turn starting at the
             highest initiative count, then continuing on in decreasing order.</p>
            <p>Creatures who join combat after it starts roll initiative at the start of the next round and
             start taking their turns thereafter.</p>
            
            <h2>Determining Surprise</h2>
            <p>At the start of combat, the GM determines who, if anyone, is surprised. Surprised
             creatures roll their initiative as normal, however they do not partake in
             the first round of combat and attacks against them during this time have
             advantage.</p>
            
            <h2>Determining Position</h2>
            <p>When combat starts, it is important to determine where everyone is placed on the 
             battlefield, if that hasn’t been done already. If playing using a grid or some sort of 
             map, this part should be trivial. If there is no such grid or the party has chosen to 
             go the Theater of the Mind route, then the GM will, for the most part, determine where 
             everyone on the battlefield is, with the help of the players and their chosen marching
             order or previously stated positions.</p>
            
            <h2>Taking Your Turn</h2>
            <p>Once initiative has been rolled, surprise has been determined, and the combatants’
             positions established, combat begins in earnest. Every round of combat lasts 6 seconds, and each 
             creature’s turn describes what they are doing during that 6 seconds using their actions and 
             reaction. Pay attention as each combatant takes their turn, so that
             when your turn comes around, you can utilize it to its fullest potential.</p>
            
            <h2>Attacking</h2>
            <p>Most of the time, attacking with a given weapon uses up a single action, though some
             weapons require the use of more than one; the number of actions you have on each of your turns
             is determined by your <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">DEX score</a>.
             Generally, there are two forms of attacks a character can make: attacking in melee
             and attacking at range.</p>
            <p><b>Attacking in Melee.</b> Most melee weapons, unless they have the <b>long</b>
             property, have a range of 2m. Melee attacks are reduced by a creature’s DEF 
             score.</p>
            <p><b>Attacking at Range.</b> A ranged weapon’s standard range and long range are
             listed next to their <a href="../Part5/Chapter2.html">ammunition</a>. If an attack
             is made in the weapon’s standard range, the attack is made as normal. If the attack
             is made in the weapon’s long range or against a <a href="./Chapter3.html">prone</a>
             target, then it has disadvantage. For Archery weapons, firing while 
             <a href="./Chapter3.html">prone</a> also grants disadvantage, whereas with Firearm
             weapons, firing while <a href="./Chapter3.html">prone</a> grants advantage. 
             Lastly, ranged attacks made in melee range with two-handed weapons have 
             disadvantage, but such attacks with one-handed weapons do not. Ranged attacks are
             always reduced by a creature’s RaDEF score.</p>
            
            <h2>Flanking</h2>
            <p>A creature can only be considered flanked in melee combat, and when flanked, all 
             attacks against that creature have advantage. A creature can be considered flanked
             under two conditions: the first is when 3 or more creatures are engaging it in 
             melee combat at once, and the second is if 2 or more creatures are on physically
             opposite sides of the creature.</p>
            
            <h2>Cleaving Through Creatures</h2>
            <p>If a character deals enough damage to a creature with a melee attack to reduce 
             them to 0 Health, consider allowing the leftover damage from the attack to apply to an 
             adjacent creature of the player’s choice without requiring the character to make another 
             attack.</p>
            
            <h2>Controlling Space</h2>
            <p><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Part 1, Chapter 8</a> details the categorization of 
             differently sized creatures and quantifies the amount of space each size category occupies in 
             combat. When attempting to navigate or move through a friendly creature’s 
             space, you can do so freely if it allows you to. If the creature is hostile or will 
             otherwise not allow you to move through its space, you must make a STR check contested
             against the other creature’s STR check.</p>
            
            <h2>Falling, Drowning & Suffocating, and Burning</h2>
            <p><b>Falling.</b> When a creature falls, for every 3m it is in free fall, it 
             takes an amount of physical damage that varies depending on their 
             <a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>, to a maximum of 190 damage dice. If they
             land on something other than a flat surface, such as spikes in the bottom of a pit,
             they take damage from whatever they land on in addition to their fall damage. 
             Should they land on another creature, both creatures take the fall damage. For 
             relatively small distances, it can be assumed that a creature falls the given
             distance instantaneously; however, for distances of <u>></u> 30m,
             assume the creature falls 30m/sec.</p>
            <p><b>Drowning & Suffocating.</b> When a creature is drowning or 
             suffocating, if it is taken by surprise, it has a number of rounds equal to its CON 
             score (minimum 1) until it runs out of breath and goes <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a>;
             if it manages to properly hold its breath, it has a number of minutes equal to its CON
             score (minimum 30 seconds) until it goes <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a>.
             If it goes <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> while 
             drowning/suffocating, it has a number of minutes equal to its CON score (minimum 1)
             until its brain shuts down and it dies; during this time, for each minute that passes,
             its INT score is reduced by .5.</p>
            <p><b>Burning.</b> A creature or object that has been lit on fire takes 1d6
             final burn damage at the start and end of each of their turns until the flame is put out 
             or they die.</p>
            
            <h2>Cover</h2>
            <p>There are two kinds of cover in I&A: partial cover, which refers to any cover 
             that covers at least half of the defending creature's body, and total cover, which
             applies when a creature's body is completely covered and unreachable by another 
             creature or weapon. When a creature is behind partial cover, all attacks against 
             them have disadvantage, and when in total cover, they cannot be targeted by attacks
             at all.</p>
            <p>If a creature is using another as cover, the attacker first rolls their attack 
             against their target with disadvantage like they normally would; if they deal no 
             final damage, then they must roll their attack again, this time without disadvantage,
             and this time against the creature being used as cover.</p>
            
            <h2>Fighting Underwater</h2>
            <p>When fighting underwater, non-aquatic creatures’ attacks have disadvantage, and if they are a 
             non-aquatic creature, their swimming speed is their Swim proficiency + their STR 
             score. While underwater, a typical creature can hold their breath for a number of 
             minutes equal to their CON score (minimum 30 seconds). Flintlocks and arquebuses cannot fire 
             underwater.</p>
            
            <h2>Combat Objectives</h2>
            <p>Though this need not always be the case, combat in I&A usually falls 
             into one of five categories: Chase, Control, Last Team Standing, Survival, or Very 
             Important Target (VIT). If you feel that your combat encounters are starting to become a
             bit dull, perhaps consider that the reason for this is that the objective is always the
             same, and simply needs a bit of variety in order to spice things up and make encounters 
             interesting again.</p>
            <p><b>Chase.</b> Chases are a relatively unique form of combat and are
             covered <a href="./Chapter12.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Control.</b> The objective of a Control-based encounter is for one 
             party to obtain and/or maintain their grasp on a specific area or object, such as a room
             or building, for as long as that thing is being threatened.</p>
            <p>For example, say the party is entrusted with guarding a large and 
             expensive machine, one that requires a certain amount of time for it to perform a desired
             function. If it is interrupted during its task, it will break, or otherwise cease to 
             perform as desired. The thing being controlled here is the machine, as it must be 
             defended until its work is complete.</p>
            <p><b>Last Team Standing.</b> Probably the most frequent combat objective, 
             as well as the easiest to implement, Last Team Standing simply wages one group of 
             participants against the other, and whichever team is still standing at the end is the 
             victor.</p>
            <p>An example would be a band of adventurers assaulting a nest of giant 
             spiders; the adventurers’ goal is to kill the spiders, while the spiders wish to 
             eliminate the adventurers and defend their home.</p>
            <p><b>Survival.</b> Somewhat similar to Last Team Standing, Survival sees 
             one group try to survive as long as they can against an overwhelming hostile force,
             dealing with enemy blades and attrition in equal measures. To avoid having combats such
             as these become too boring or drag on for too long, it is advised that the GM have some 
             sort of event planned to occur after a few rounds of combat have passed, allowing the 
             plot to move forward and to keep the encounter from dragging on, either into (seeming) 
             infinity or until the PCs all die.</p>
            <p>One such instance of this is the PCs find themselves in the middle of a
             warzone, with hordes of Orks assaulting a sizable Sentient settlement. The first few 
             rounds see the PCs out on the battlefield outside the settlement walls, keeping the Orks
             at bay while the townspeople have time to fortify their defenses, or evacuate, or say
             their final prayers – whichever the GM decides. Suddenly, an Ork warchief arrives on the
             battlefield, relatively huge and looming over everything in sight. Now the PCs have a 
             new target and a new goal: end the battle by killing or capturing the Ork warchief. This 
             new development would also turn this combat into the next and final type of combat, Very 
             Important Target.</p>
            <p><b>Very Important Target (VIT).</b> Last but not least is VIT combat, 
             wherein a person or object is designated more important than the other actors in play, 
             and must be eliminated or obtained by one or more parties in order for combat to end.</p>
            <p>As an example, say a group of assassins wishes to eliminate an important 
             noble, and to do this, they must get past her bodyguards. If this situation comes to blows, 
             the assassins’ objective is just to eliminate the noble, and everything aside from that is
             secondary. Once their task is complete, they are free to leave, assuming they have no 
             other necessary objectives.</p>
