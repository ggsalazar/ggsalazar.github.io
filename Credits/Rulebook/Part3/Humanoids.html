                 eyes and ears to survive, Darklings’ sense of hearing is a bit more enhanced than most, 
                 increasing your Perception proficiency by 1, up to 5; additionally, Darklings’ dark flesh 
                 allows them to blend in easily with darkness, increasing your Stealth proficiency by 1, up

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Dwarves</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Dwarf Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Dwarf skin is thicker and tougher than other races’, and 
                 greys as they get older. They don’t grow any hair on top of their head, but do 
                 tend to grow thick and mangy beards the same color as their skin, with the females’
                 typically growing longer than the males’.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Dwarves live a rather long while, about 200 
                 years, and reach full maturity by their 40th year.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Dwarves are a bit small but

                 16m.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Even though Dwarves are Small, their natural
                 stockiness negates the typical STR loss/DEX gain.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Dwarves are short and stocky humanoids, and the following are several Heritage

                <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Though all Elves do generally retain their tall height and 
                 lithe forms, each subrace has its own unique physical features, described in the
                 subrace description.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> An Elf's candle burns bright but short, typically
                 averaging around 50, sometimes reaching 60 years, and they reach maturity 
                 around 7 years old.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Elves are tall, with the 
                 shortest approaching but not going beneath 180cm and the tallest going up

                <b>Subraces.</b> There are 8 subraces of Elves: city, dark, forest, frost, 
                 mountain, plains, sand, and water. Pick one for your character.
                
                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">City Elves</h2>
                City Elves are those who have taken to urban and city living, abandoning nature
                 for a more technologically-inclined life. City Elves typically value hard work
                 and living for oneself, rather than devoting their livelihood to the betterment
                 of their community like most other Elves. They are also the most diverse of all
                 the Elves in terms of philosophical outlook, morality, appearance, skillsets, 
                 and tastes.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> The physical appearance of a City Elf is extremely variable,
                 with very few commonalities between any given two. There is no typical skin, 
                 hair, or eye color, and it is not uncommon to see a City Elf with a bit of
                 webbing between their fingers or a distinct streak of leafy green hair.<br>
                <b>Apprenticed and Practiced (Extra Skills).</b> Your city life has given you practice with
                 a single set of tools, granting you 1 proficiency in a single Tool Skill of your choice;
                 additionally, your life among urban folk grants you 1 proficiency in any one Action Skill of
                 your choice.<br>
                <b>Dumb Luck.</b> Once between night’s rests, you can choose to grant yourself 
                 advantage on any attack, check, or save.<br>
                <b>Multi-Lingual.</b> Your proximity to the many other peoples of the world means
                 that you have learned to speak and write one extra <a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">language</a>
                 of your choice.
                
                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Dark Elves</h2>
                Dark Elves are those who have learned to survive for a few generations in dark 
                 and dank places, typically deep cave and mining systems or other underground 
                 environs. This has granted them infrared sight and darker appearances than most
                 other races, second only to Darklings.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Dark Elves, as the name would imply, are quite dark in 
                 appearance, with their skin tones ranging from dark blue to purple to gray to
                 black. Their hair and eyes follow much the same pattern, except that their eyes
                 can also be red.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter6.html">Infrared Sight</a>.</b> Dark Elves can see 
                 in the infrared spectrum, allowing them to see in the dark more or less just as
                 easily as in the light; when using their thermal vision, their eye color changes
                 to red.<br>
                <b>Keen Ears and Natural Stealth (Extra Skills).</b> Dark Elves have learned to rely on their
                 ears just as well as their eyes, increasing their Perception proficiency by 1; additionally,
                 your darker skin allows you to more easily blend into the darkness, increasing your Stealth
                 proficiency by 1<br>
                <b>Multi-Lingual.</b> In addition to Common and Elvish, you can also speak and
                 write Dark-Speak.
                
                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Forest Elves</h2>
                Forest Elves have become accustomed to living in wooded, forested, and jungled
                 areas.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Forest Elves generally have light green skin, their hair 
                 varies from green to brown to red to brown, and their eyes vary from brown to
                 green to occasionally blue. They are lean and agile, even for Elves.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Your time navigating the woodlands makes you
                 faster on your feet, increasing your AGI score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Nature Affinity (Extra Skills).</b> Your time within nature increases your 
                 proficiency in the Beast Handling and Nature skills by 1, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Adaptability (Poison).</b> Forest Elves have built up a resistance to dangerous
                 toxins in their environment, granting you resistance to poison damage and 
                 advantage on saves against poisons and diseases.
                
                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Frost Elves</h2>
                Frost Elves are Elves that have acclimated to cold and snowy environments.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> You have pale white skin with slight blue undertones, white to
                 blue hair, and eyes that vary from white to blue to green. Frost Elves also tend
                 to be a bit huskier and hairier than other races, given that they live in colder
                 environs.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your CON score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Cold Acclimated (Adaptability).</b> You are resistant to freeze damage.<br>
                <b>Thick Skin.</b> Your body's natural resistance to the cold also protects you
                 a bit from other dangers, increasing your base Armor score to 2.
                
                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Mountain Elves</h2>
                The Elves of the mountains are strong and hardy, more akin to dwarves than any other race.
                 As their name would imply, they have built their homes in the mountains and tall hills of the 
                 world. They are slightly more stout than the rest of the Elves, but they are also more sturdy 
                 and have stronger lungs (as well as being more stubborn).<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> The skin, hair, and eyes of Mountain Elves are all various
                 shades of grey and brown.<br>

                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Plains Elves</h2>
                Elves who live in the plains and grasslands of the world are Plains Elves.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Elves of the plains tend to be slightly tan and have dark eyes
                 and hair. Like Forest Elves, they are lean and agile.<br>

                <b>Extra Skills.</b> You gain 1 proficiency in Survival and Vehicles (Land), each up to 5.<br>

                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Sand Elves</h2>
                Sand Elves are those that have grown accustomed to hot and arid climates, 
                 typically living in or near deserts. Many Sand Elves – though not all – are 
                 nomadic, constantly wandering through or across the deserts they call home, 
                 sometimes building cities, though this is a rare occasion.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Sand Elves have very dark characteristics, with dark skin, hair, 
                 and eyes.<br>
                <b>Extra Skills.</b> You gain 1 proficiency in Survival and Vehicles (Land), each

                <h2 style="text-decoration:none;">Water Elves</h2>
                Having built their lives and communities in the more aquatic climes of the world, Water Elves
                 have made their homes in wetlands, swamps, and shallow waters. They have very strong lungs and 
                 are natural swimmers.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Water Elves are light blue to sea-green in skin, hair, and 
                 eye tone, and scales or webbed appendages are not uncommon.<br>

                <b>Fins and Gills.</b> Your Swim proficiency increases by 1, and can be increased
