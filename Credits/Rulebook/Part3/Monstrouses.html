            <div class="content">
                <h2>Drakon Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Drakon are covered head-to-toe in scales and have sharp teeth,
                 claws, and prehensile tails. Horns of various lengths and styles decorate their heads,

                 than females. Their eye colors are usually green, red, yellow, or blue.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Drakon usually live to be about 80. They reach
                 maturity at around 15.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Drakon vary from about 180 -
                 210cm tall and are stocky in build, usually around 200 – 300 pounds. 
                 They are Big creatures.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak and write
                 Common and Drake.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Drakon have a Dodge Penalty of -4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Being Big, your RaDEF is your DEF + 2.<br>
                <b>Base Movement.</b> Drakon have 24 meters of base Movement.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Since you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and
                 lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Drakon are dragon-like, and the following are several Heritage features that
                 fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage feature list.<br>
                <b>Breath Weapon.</b> Select one of the 12 elements (Air, Earth, Fire, Water,
                 Death, Gravity, Life, Magic, Dark, Light, Space, or Time): once between night’s
                 rests, you can use 2 actions to exhale a 5-meter cone or 8-meter line of damaging energy that
                 deals a type of damage that matches the nature of the element you chose. If the
                 element you chose can deal more than one type of damage (such as how Fire can
                 deal burn or electric damage), you can choose what type of damage is dealt at 
                 the time you exhale the energy. You must select the element at character
                 creation and it cannot be changed. This energy deals 1d8 base damage and scales
                 to your CON score (e.g. 3d8 + 3.5 with a CON score of 3.5).<br>
                <b>Claws and Fangs.</b> Drakon have sharp claws, which count as Unarmed weapons 
                 and deal 1d4 physical base damage.<br>
                <b>Scales.</b> Drakon are covered in scales that increases their base Armor score
                 to 2.<br>
                <b>Tail.</b> You have a prehensile tail, which is flexible, long, and strong
                 enough to essentially function as a 3rd arm.<br>
                <b>Wings.</b> You have a pair of leathery wings that grant you a flying speed; 
                 this flying speed is determined by your Size and STR score in the same manner 
                 your walking speed is determined by your Size and AGI score.
