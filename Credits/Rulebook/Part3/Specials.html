            <p>Certain Heritages simply do not fit into the given archetypes for one reason or 
             another, usually due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding their creation. 
             Given here are three such Heritages and their innate abilities, as well as what 
             they may get from their parents, if anything.</p>
            
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Automata</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Wire and Metal</h2>
                Automata are not born but created, literally built using wiring, machine parts, 
                 and Life Aether – and it is this last ingredient that sets them apart from other 
                 machines, as that is what gives them their sentience. When an Automaton is first built,
                 it begins its life unthinking and unfeeling, like any other construct. However, as time
                 wears on, it Awakens, becoming aware of itself as it starts to feel and decide what to 
                 do of its own accord. Once they have Awakened, Automata are mentally and emotionally 
                 indistinguishable from other Sentients.<br>
                
                <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                Because Automata are constructs, they do require some daily maintenance. Once a 
                 day, an Automaton must ingest a gallon of fuel to keep themselves running, though they 
                 can go about 4 days without it before their systems start to shut down – an analogy
                 to the naturally-occurring hunger of other races would be appropriate.<br>
                In addition, once every day, Automata must enter a 3-hour hibernation 
                 period, wherein most of their systems shut down, their working memory clears, and their 
                 storage is re-organized. This resting period can be voluntarily held off, though an 
                 Automaton’s systems will slowly deteriorate as time without it goes on; again, an analogy
                 to a need for sleep would be fitting.<br>
                Lastly, while Automata are made of metal and cannot technically drown, 
                 being submerged can be dangerous for them as the fluid may damage their fuel cells or clog 
                 and slow down their machinery or other systems (being washed, however, is safe). A submerged
                 Automaton has a number of minutes equal to their CON modifier before their systems shut
                 down and they die (minimum 30 seconds). However, since they do not have respiratory 
                 systems, Automata do not have to worry about breathing in dangerous vapors.<br>
                 
                <h2>Automata Name Examples</h2>
                Automata are typically named after the sounds their bodies make, a prominent piece of 
                 their body, or the role they were made to fulfill. Some Automata decide to take up an entirely
                 new name for themselves upon Awakening, but this is not necessarily always the case. Automata 
                 are asexual, so there is no differentiation between male or female names.<br>
                <b>Names.</b> Bang, Battery, Brasshead, Clank, Creak, Friend, Gasket, Gear, 
                 Golem, Number 23, Piston, Protector, Soldier, Steam, Whistle.<br>
                
                <h2>Automata Traits</h2>
                <b>Varied Appearance.</b> The specifics of Automata appearance and size can vary greatly, 
                 as they can be made in pretty much any image. However, some commonalities exist; all Automata are
                 made of some sort of strong metal, usually steel. Some mithril Automata exist, though these are 
                 exceedingly rare.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> With proper long-term maintenance, Automata can theoretically 
                 live forever. This maintenance includes oiling, fixing damages, getting rid of rust, replacing old 
                 parts, etc. Without it, they have a life expectancy of about 40 years as their parts wear down and 
                 gradually fall into disuse. Automata reach full maturity within a few years of being Awakened.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Automata vary in height from 
                 1-2 meters. They can be Small, Medium, or Big.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak 
                 and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br>
                <b>Tough Chassis.</b> Automata have a base Armor score of 3.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If your Automaton is Small/Medium/Big, you have a Dodge Penalty of
                 -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> If your Automaton is Small/Medium/Big, your RaDEF is your DEF +
                 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Base Movement.</b> Being Small/Medium/Big makes your base Movement 16/20/24m.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Electric Eyes.</b> Your mechanical eyes can double as flashlights, which you can turn on
                 using an action. While this effect is active, you have disadvantage on
                 Stealth checks. If the effect is inactive, you no longer have disadvantage on Stealth 
                 checks, however you cannot see in the dark.<br>
                <b>Machine Learning.</b> Automata’s logical and mechanical minds grants them an
                 advanced intelligence, increasing your INT score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Made of Metal.</b> You are vulnerable to <a href="../Part6/Chapter2.html">caustic</a> damage.<br>
                <b>No Lungs.</b> Because you do not breathe, you are unaffected by dangerous vapors such
                 as poisonous gas; however, you can still drown (see “Maintenance” above).<br>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Variant Automata: Four-Armed</h2>
                Some Automata are engineered with 2 extra arms built into their chassis, allowing for greater physical
                 strength and, in many, increased manual dexterity. These Automata are referred to as the Four-Armed. What the
                 Four-Armed gain in physical prowess, however, they lose in mental capability, as their extra brainpower is 
                 concentrated on keeping all of their limbs working in tandem. Use the following stats if you wish to play a 
                 Four-Armed.<br>
                <b>Varied Appearance.</b> Four-Armed are much the same appearance-wise as their bimanual counterparts.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Four-Armed are much more mechanically complex than 
                 normal Automata, and so require more regular and careful upkeep. Without it, they can go only 
                 about 30 years before they break down completely and die.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Like 
                 regular Automata, Four-Armed can be Small, Medium, or Big.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You 
                 can speak, understand, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br>
                <b>Tough Chassis.</b> Four-Armed also have a base Armor score of 2.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Small/Medium/Big Four-Armed have a Dodge Penalty of -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Small/Medium/Big Four-Armed have a RaDEF of their DEF + 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Base Movement.</b> Being Small/Medium/Big makes your base Movement 16/20/24m.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Electric Eyes.</b> Four-Armed eyes also double as flashlights in much
                 the same way as the Automatas' do, granting you the benefits of the <b>Electric Eyes</b> trait, 
                 described above.<br>
                <b>Made of Metal.</b> You are vulnerable to <a href="../Part6/Chapter2.html">caustic</a> damage.<br>
                <b>No Lungs.</b> Because you do not breathe, you are unaffected by dangerous 
                 vapors such as poisonous gas; however, you can still drown (see “Maintenance” above).<br>
                <b>Quadridextrous.</b> You have 4 arms instead of 2. Your extra arms can be 
                 stored inside your chassis until you use them, making you appear as a normal 
                 Automata until they come out.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Dhampir</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Spawn of Life and Undeath</h2>
                Dhampir are born from the union between a Sentient and a Major Vampire Spawn. 
                 As such, they are neither Undead nor alive, and spells that affect Undead usually do 
                 so at a much lesser degree for them than they would a full Undead. Like their Vampire 
                 Spawn parent, they tend to be pale, like a corpse.<br>
                Dhampir bodies do age and they are fully sentient, but that hasn’t 
                 stopped many from believing that they are just as monstrous as their Undead parent; 
                 because of this, Dhampir typically face extreme prejudice, sometimes warranted and 
                 sometimes not. If they are careful, they are able to live decently 
                 normal lives.<br>
                 
                <h2>A Life on the Move</h2>
                Many Dhampir often have trouble finding reliable, stable sources of food; though 
                 they are able to steal blood in the night from hapless victims in whatever town they 
                 happen to be staying in, most take up a life on the road, sometimes alone, but more 
                 frequently in groups comprised of trusted allies. This constant migration usually leads
                 to a life of adventuring, though not always. Some Dhampir simply choose to live out 
                 their lives with their Vampire Spawn parent, and for them life is much simpler, if 
                 darker.<br>
                
                <h2>Dhampir Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Individual Dhampir vary wildly in appearance, following the trends
                 of their parents’ races. They are more pale than normal, however.<br>
                <b>Age.</b> Dhampir have a natural lifespan of about 500 years, and reach 
                 maturity at about 20.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Your size is based entirely on the
                 sizes of both your parents.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak, 
                 read, and write Common and Mortuan.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score, like your size, depends entirely on your
                 Heritage. If neither of your parents would give you an Armor bonus, your base
                 Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your Dodge Penalty is -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> As a Small/Medium/Big creature, your RaDEF is your DEF + 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Base Movement.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your base Movement is 16/20/24m.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Infrared Vision.</b> You can see in the infrared spectrum; your eyes become 
                 red when you do.<br>
                <b>Semi-Vampyric Physique.</b> Your STR and AGI scores both increase by .5, up 
                 to 5.<br>
                <b>Partial Undead Nature.</b> You have advantage on saves against poisons & diseases 
                 and being put to sleep against your will, and you only need to sleep for 3 hours.<br>
                <b>Bloodthirst.</b> Dhampir require the blood of living Sentients to stay 
                 alive, in addition to half as much normal food as a normal Sentient would eat. 1 quart
                 of Sentient blood must be consumed every 15 days, and it can be taken willingly or 
                 otherwise (see the “Bloodfeast” feature below). If enough blood is not consumed, your
                 maximum Health is temporarily reduced by 25% every two weeks until you either die or
                 consume blood, at which point your maximum Health is restored by 25%.<br>
                <b>Bloodfeast.</b> Once between night’s rests, you can use 2 actions 
                to make an Unarmed attack (1d4 physical base damage, DEX property) against one target 
                that is a Sentient. If you deal final damage, the target is <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                by you, and you can then choose to spend another action drinking the target’s blood,
                quenching your Bloodthirst and healing you for half the final damage dealt (rounded up);
                however, doing so will also cause you to be <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                until the start of your next turn. If the target is diseased or poisoned, you must pass
                a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save with a DR equal 
                to the original poison or disease, otherwise you now suffer from the same affliction. If
                the victim is willing, do not subtract their DEF score from your attack roll.
            <br>

            </div>
            
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Elementia</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Children of the Elements</h2>
                A Sentient with <a href="../Part7/Chapter1.html">Aether</a> fused into
                 their very being, an Elementia is an incredibly special creature. They are the child
                 of two Sentients with the essence of a single element ingrained into their very DNA, 
                 altering their appearance accordingly and giving them incredible extranatural powers unlike
                 those wielded by any other breed of Sentients.<br>
                There are three circumstances that create such a being: the first is when 
                 a child is born on one of the <a href="../Part7/Chapter5.html">Elemental Planes</a>
                 – though this may create an <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>,
                 there is an equal chance (1 in 3) that the child will instead become an 
                 Elementia; one other way is when one or two especially powerful (Level 11 or 
                 higher) <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> have a child – if it 
                 is just one such <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>, there is a 
                 25% chance the child will be an Elementia of the sorcerer’s element, and if two                 
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> have a child together, there
                 is a 50% chance that the child will be an Elementia of 1 of the parents’ 
                 elements; the last way is if two Elementia decide to have a child, then the 
                 child will be a full Elementia of one of the two types.<br>
                Elementia are… anomalies, to put it lightly. Fire Elementia may be mistaken for 
                 demons, Air Elementia could be regarded as angels, Dark Elementia mistaken for 
                 Dark Elves, etc. Because of this, many Elementia shun social interaction, some
                 going to great lengths to hide their extranatural features, or going into 
                 self-imposed exile and living as outcasts. Other Elementia take this special 
                 treatment and use it to their advantage, tricking the less intelligent into
                 worshipping them as gods or demigods, or using their visage and inherent power
                 to work their way into positions of authority.<br>
                 
                <h2>Elementia Traits</h2>
                There are, technically, 12 subraces of Elementia – one for each element –
                 however, the majority of their traits are similar enough to only be described 
                 once, and it is up to you to fill in the blanks and use the traits given as a 
                 skeletal framework to create your Elementia.<br>
                <b>Elemental.</b> Every Elementia has the essence of one of the 12 elements – 
                 Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Death, Gravity, Life, Magic, Dark, Light, Space, or 
                 Time – infused into their very being due to the extranatural/arcane 
                 circumstances of their birth. Pick one of the elements for your character, and
                 use that as the main guideline around which your Elementia’s traits are based.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b>An Elementia’s appearance is dependent on which element has 
                 bonded to their body. Briefly described here is a vague guideline for each 
                 element:<br>
                <i>Air</i> - Light gray skin, white, gray, or light blue hair and eye color.
                 Hair frequently appears to float or billow softly unprompted.<br>
                <i>Earth</i> - Skin color varies from dark brown to light green, variable eye 
                 and hair color. Hair is usually curly, and body odor may be more akin to ozone
                 or wet soil.<br>
                <i>Fire</i> - Skin color is usually red or orange, eyes may be red, orange, 
                 yellow, or blue. Hair is typically red, yellow, or orange, and strands or bits
                 of it may dance on their own.<br>
                <i>Water</i> - Deep blue to dark green skin and eye tones, variable hair color.
                 Hair may sometimes appear to float as though submerged.<br>
                <i>Death</i> - Dark gray skin, variable hair and eye color. Body odor may be
                 more akin to a fresh corpse.<br>
                <i>Gravity</i> - Light to dark gray skin, hair, and eye tones. Hair may start to
                 float as if weightless or drop as though weighed down randomly.<br>
                <i>Life</i> - Skin tones vary from pale green to turquoise to pale blue. Eye
                 color varies from green to blue, hair color tends to match skin color.<br>
                <i>Magic</i> - Purple to blue skin tones, eyes are a deep blue, green, or 
                 purple. Occasional gentle sparkles may appear around face or hands, or in the
                 eyes.<br>
                <i>Dark</i> - Dark skin, sometimes dark hair. Eyes frequently have the 
                 appearance of pupil-less voids.<br>
                <i>Light</i> - White to light yellow skin tones, white to yellow tones for hair
                 and eyes. Hair and/or eyes may start to glow gently during periods of great 
                 emotional excitement.<br>
                <i>Space</i> - Normal, though slightly off-color skin, hair, and eye tones from
                 Heritage. The space around them tends to seem to shift and move in unnatural 
                 ways.<br>
                <i>Time</i> - Normal, though slightly off-color skin, hair, and eye tones from
                 Heritage. Extremities and small parts such as hands, feet, eyes, and hair may
                 appear to move unnaturally quickly or slowly at random.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Elementia share the life expectancy and maturity rate of
                 their parents.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> You are the same size as your 
                 parents’ Heritage(s).<br>

                 one other language of your choice (usually that of your Heritage), and the 
                 language of your element.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your Dodge Penalty is -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your RaDEF score is your DEF + 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Base Movement.</b> Being Small/Medium/Big makes your base Movement 16/20/24m.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>

                 regain this Mana after night's or day's rests. If you become an 
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>, this Mana stacks with the Mana you gain
                 from that class.<br>
