            <h2>Extra Tidbits</h2>
            <p>Sometimes – perhaps because your background calls for it, or maybe because you 
             decided you wanted your character to have some extra flavor, or possibly the GM wants 
             to add a bit of spice to a room’s contents and description – a situation calls for a 
             couple of extra items, or a token or trinket that adds just a touch of extra life, 
             something to inspire you and get you thinking about your character’s life before they 
             went on their adventures.</p>
            <p>The following table contains a list of 100 sample trinkets that can 
             add some flavor to any character, should any player or GM feel the desire to do so. You
             can roll to decide which trinket(s) your character gets, or simply pick whichever
             one(s) you like. It is recommended that you have no more than 3.</p>
