            <p>Weapons are the bread and butter of any adventurer’s kit; any fighter worth their
             salt can tell a flail from a mace and a spear from a glaive. You choose what weapons you
             want proficiency in at character creation, and leveling up, time spent training, and/or
             feats can give you proficiency with even more. No matter what your martial preference is,
             the ability to wield your arms effectively can be the difference between a grisly death
             and adventures so wild not even the most creative minstrel could dream them up.</p>
            <p>The <b>Normal Weapons</b>, <b>Exotic Weapons</b>, and <b>Trick Weapons</b>
             tables give a list of many of the different weapons and weapon types throughout
             this ruleset. These tables include their names, price, weight, base damage, and any 
             special properties they may have.</p>
            <p><b>Base Damage.</b> The amount of damage listed for a given weapon is that
             weapon’s Base Damage; it is the damage it deals if the character wielding it has 1 
             <a href="../Part1/Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> with the type of weapon that
             that weapon belongs to. For every <a href="../Part1/Chapter3.html">proficiency</a>
             above 1 that a character has with that weapon type, the amount of damage die rolled
             in addition to the base damage is increased by 1.</p>
            <p><b>Action Cost.</b> How many actions a character must use to attack with the 
             weapon once. If a character has fewer than the required amount of actions at their
             disposal, they can use the rest of their actions to attack with the weapon once 
             with disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Properties.</b> The properties of a weapon give a list of any special 
             characteristics a weapon may have, if any:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom:0;">
                    <li><b>Ammunition.</b> Weapons with the Ammunition property require a 
                     specified amount of projectiles to be loaded into them before you can 
                     attack with them. Weapons with this property have their range/long range
                     listed next to their ammunition types. Attacks with the weapon made in 
                     their standard range are made normally; attacks made at long range and at
                     melee range are made with disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><b>Description.</b> Some weapons have special abilities or 
                     characteristics to them that can’t be summarized in just a couple of words.
                     These weapons have the Description property, and their unique property is 
                     described in detail in their weapon description at the end of the list.</li>
                    <li><b>DEX(*).</b> Weapons with the DEX property can use DEX for their 
                     attacks instead of STR if the player using them so wishes; without this
                     property, a weapon can only use STR for its attacks, unless otherwise 
                     stated by a special exception. Additionally, if a weapon has the DEX*
                     property, then the wielder must use their DEX score when making attacks
                     with this weapon.</li>
                    <li><b>Long.</b> Some melee weapons have a 4-meter range, longer than the 
                     standard 2 meters that most melee weapons have. These weapons have the Long
                     property, and if they have a further reach than 4 meters, their range will 
                     be listed in parentheses next to this property. In narrow spaces, attacks
                     with weapons with this property have disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><b>Reload.</b> A weapon that requires <u>></u> 1 action(s) to be
                     reloaded has the Reload property; the number of actions required
                     will be given in parentheses next to the property.</li>
                    <li><b>STR x.</b> A weapon with “STR x” (e.g. STR 3) requires a STR score
                     <u>></u> the value given in order to be wielded.</li>
                    <li><b>Two-handed.</b> Weapons with the Two-handed property are large and hefty,
                     requiring two hands to be able to effectively wield in battle; additionally, their size
                     means that they take up two equipment slots on your character sheet, whereas one-handed
                     weapons take up only one. Weapons with this property cannot be dual-wielded without the
                     “Two-handed Dual-Wielding” classless feat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Additional Weapons.</b> <a href="./Chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a> has a handful of additional
                 weapons listed, such as the grenade, the blunderbuss, and the flamethrower; these weapons are
                 listed there and not here because their damage is set and does not scale with any skill.</p>

            <p><b>Bola.</b> Bolas are a typed of throwing weapon consisting of two weights
             linked together by a length of durable cord, usually rope or chain. When thrown at a 
             target, they must make a Reflex save contested against your DEX check or be 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a> as the bola wraps around 
             them. They can escape by either using 2 actions to destroy the cord or by making a STR
             check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes 2 actions.</p>
            <p><b>Boomerang.</b> A boomerang is a flattened and curved piece of wood or light metal;
             though most boomerangs are a single length of wood bent at almost 90 degrees towards the 
             middle, other variations do exist. In any case, a boomerang is a ranged weapon that is 
             designed to return to the user after being thrown. When attacking with this weapon, if it
             hits nothing during its flight path, it returns to the spot where it was thrown.</p>
            <p><b>Long-Range Rifle.</b> A true beast of a gun, the Long-Range Rifle (LRR) is a force
             to be reckoned with. Like an arquebus or a flintlock, it can only be fired once before needing
             to be reloaded, however its range and firepower greatly exceed its gunpowder-based brethren.
             Additionally, due to the weapon's immense size and weight, all attacks with it inherently have
             disadvantage; however, remember that Firearm weapons fired while 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">prone</a> have advantage, negating that setback.</p>
            <p><b>Net.</b> Nets function much the same way bolas do, though their appearance
             is quite different. When thrown at a target, they must make a Reflex save contested against your
             DEX check or be <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">restrained</a> as the net 
             entangles them. They can escape by either using a 2 actions to destroy the net or by making a STR 
             check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes 2 actions.</p>
            <p><b>Repeater.</b> Coming in a variety of forms, such as the lever-action, pump-action, or
             bolt-action, repeaters are rifles that, like revolvers, can be fired 6 times before needing to
             be reloaded. However, unlike revolvers, the user must manually chamber each round after firing,
             which requires the use of an action. When reloading a repeater, the user can load up to 2 bullets
             using a single action, meaning it takes 3 actions to fully load a repeater.</p>
            <p><b>Revolver.</b> Revolvers are hand-held firearms that, like repeaters, can be fired 6 times
             before needing to be reloaded. Unlike repeaters, an action is not required to chamber the next
             round into the cartridge, allowing them to be fired much faster. Additionally, just like reloading
             a repeater, the user can use an action to load up to 2 bullets into the cylinder, meaning that a
             revolver requires 3 actions to be completely loaded.</p>
            <p><b>Trident.</b> Attacking with the points of a trident requires 2 actions to be 
             done effectively, but striking with the blunt sides of the points and butt - as 
             though it were a staff - can be done much more quickly, allowing the user to strike
             with the weapon more frequently; the trade-off for this is that attacking this way
             reduces the base damage die to a d6, also like a staff.</p>
             
            <h2>Exotic Weapons</h2>
            <p>Exotic weapons are unique and/or rare weapons that require specialized training to be used
             effectively. Most are foreign to the vast majority; even veteran fighters are usually not quite 
             sure how to handle one when they first encounter it.</p>
            <p><b>Proficiency.</b> Proficiency with exotic weapons is not like proficiency with
             other Weapon Skills; instead, proficiency for each Exotic weapon is unique to that weapon. For 
             instance, a character with 2 proficiency with hook blades would not have the same proficiency 
             with bladed fans or tri-staves. In addition, if an Exotic weapon has the <b>Thrown</b> property,
             a character could use their proficiency with the weapon itself or their Throwing proficiency when 
             making attacks with that weapon. Similar to every other weapon skill, it takes 1 Weapon Point for
             proficiency with an Exotic weapon to increase by 1.</p>

            <p><b>Bladed Fan.</b> A bladed fan appears to be a traditional folding fan, but 
             with a razor-sharp metal edge. Typically dual-wielded but do not have to be.</p>
            <p><b>Chakram.</b> A chakram is a circular bladed weapon, disc-shaped with the blade 
             covering most of the outside edge, with the exception of a handle big enough for only one hand. This 
             weapon can be effectively wielded as either a melee or a ranged weapon.</p>
            <p><b>Double-bladed Staff.</b> A double-bladed staff is a staff with a single or double-edged 
             blade attached at each end.</p>
            <p><b>Hook Blades.</b> Hook blades greatly resemble thin swords, with the exception that their
             ends are curved. Because of this, hook blades are often dual-wielded, so that they can quickly and easily link
             together to strike enemies further away. The hooks can also be used to grab and manipulate certain items or body
             parts, such as ankles, shoulders, tree branches, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Krull.</b> A krull looks something like a bladed star, except that this particular “star”
             is akin to 5 daggers that have been fused at the handles and the blades are slightly curved. The design of 
             the krull, with the inner half acting as a handle and the outer 
             half being comprised of curved blades, allows it to be effectively wielded both in melee and as a thrown weapon.</p>
            <p><b>Kyoketsu-shoge.</b> Kyoketsu-shoge are comprised of a 5-meter-long chain or 
             cord with a ring of metal attached at one end and a blade at the other. The ring of
             metal is blunt and roughly as wide as a Medium-sized creature’s hand. This is 
             commonly used as a handle, or it can have other items looped through it to be used as
             a fulcrum. The blade has its own handle as well as both a hook and a point,
             allowing it to be used as both an effective melee weapon and a grappling hook. 
             Attacks made with the kyoketsu-shoge in confined spaces do not have disadvantage if
             they are against a target in melee range.</p>
            <p><b>Meteor Hammer.</b> A meteor hammer is a heavy weight or ball attached to a durable length
             of cord or rope, usually about 3 meters in length, that is swung to attack enemies from 
             surprising and often difficult to block angles; mechanically, this means that when you attack
             with this weapon, one of the damage dice you roll is automatically taken at its highest value.
             The cord can also be used to bind enemies.</p>
            <p><b>Nun'chaku.</b> Nun’chaku, also known as nun’chuks, greatly resemble two wooden or
             metal clubs connected by a short length of chain, rope, or cord and are just as often dual-wielded as not.</p>
            <p><b>Rope Dart.</b> A rope dart is a small serrated knife (such as a kunai, which is a
             knife with a hole in the end of the handle) or dart that has a length (usually around 5m) of rope
             or chain tied to it; this allows for a number of creative uses, chief among them being that the weapon’s
             melee range is equal to the length of the cord. Additionally, when throwing the rope dart, you 
             can use an action to pull it back so long as it is within 6m of you. You can also pull 
             objects weighing 5 lbs. or less to you using an action, so long as they are not being worn or
             carried.</p>
            <p><b>Tonfa.</b> A tonfa is a club with an extra handle sticking perpendicular out
             from the main handle, about 15cm from one end. It can be wielded normally or
             while being held by the secondary handle. Tonfa are often dual-wielded.</p>
            
            <h2>Mechanical Weapons</h2>
            <p>Mechanical weapons are special weapons that contain some sort of mechanical component that 
             alters the behavior of the base weapon, such as transforming from a ranged weapon to a melee 
             one at the use of an action,
             allowing a rifle to be fired without manually chambering the next round, freeing up equipment 
             slots, or some other such function. The mechanics of a mechanical weapon can be figured out with 
             a successful DR 14 Mechanics check; unless this check is passed, a character cannot figure out 
             how to properly use a mechanical weapon unless they are shown how or trained in its use.</p>

            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Hand.</b> An auto-crossbow is designed to be able to fire much more
             quickly than its non-trick counterpart. For the hand auto-crossbow, it can be fired thrice before it needs
             to be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Light.</b> Light auto-crossbows can be fired up to four times before 
             needing to be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Heavy.</b> A heavy auto-crossbow can be fired a maximum of five times
             before it must be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Bladebow, Long.</b> The long bladebow looks and functions much like a regular longbow, with
             the exception that the limbs of the bow are comprised of two curved, flexible, single-edged swords, which come 
             apart at the behest of the wielder. The string of the bow is contained within one of these swords and is 
             automatically withdrawn whenever the swords come apart. When the swords are fused together once more, the loop 
             of the string emerges from the tip of the sword containing it; the other blade has a nook behind the tip that 
             the string is then looped through, allowing it to be used as a normal longbow once more. When the swords come 
             apart, they can be treated as two separate swords; however, a person must be in possession of both before the 
             bladebow can be returned to its primary form.</p>
            <p><b>Bladebow, Short.</b> The short bladebow functions exactly like the long variation, except
             that the blades are naturally smaller and look a lot like a pair of kukri knives (use dagger statistics).</p>
            <p><b>Bracer Blade.</b> The bracer blade is a small stiletto that has been designed to slide 
             mechanically in and out of a bracer that contains it. The bracer blade can be used for stabbing
             attacks while still in the bracer, or it can be voluntarily removed to be thrown. While 
             withdrawn into the bracer, the bracer blade is completely undetectable; however, if it is
             identified, the person identifying it knows what it is and what it does. Additionally, it does
             not take up an equipment slot.</p>
            <p><b>Collapsing Krull.</b> The collapsing krull is exactly like a normal krull, 
             except that the blades retract into the handle at the press of a button, allowing
             it to be carried and handled more easily and safely.</p>
            <p><b>Collapsing Shield.</b> The collapsing shield is not a weapon, but a shield that can 
             mechanically fold together while still being worn to become more compact and portable. While not in its shield
             form, a character can use both hands completely freely, including dual-wielding and wielding weapons with the 
             <b>Two-handed</b> property. Otherwise, it is treated as a regular shield.</p>
            <p><b>Gundagger.</b> The gundagger has been built as a hybrid between the 
             flintlock and a normal dagger; it can be used as a normal dagger as desired, but
             when the safety on the pommel is released, a small trigger appears underneath the
             finger guard in the handle, allowing the flintlock part of the weapon to be fired. 
             The gundagger must then be cleaned and reloaded like a normal flintlock before it
             can be fired again, however it can still be used as a dagger until it is. In 
             addition, if the last action you performed with the gundagger was to stab a 
             creature and you have not done anything else, you can then use another action to fire the
             gundagger while it is still in the pierced creature. This shot
             is made with advantage and deals true damage.</p>
            <p><b>Gunsword.</b> The gunsword functions much like the gundagger, except that it
             is a fusion between a sword and an arquebus instead of a dagger and a flintlock. 
             In addition, in order to fire the gunsword, a character must be holding it with
             two hands. Like the gundagger, the gunsword can also be fired while inside a
             creature that you have just stabbed; you could also
             pierce a creature with the gunsword, and then use an action to fire at another creature behind
             that one, though this will not be made with 
             advantage or deal true damage.</p>
            <p><b>Semi-Automatic Repeater.</b> A semi-automatic repeater is a repeater that sacrifices a bit of power
             for the ability to automatically chamber the next round, no longer requiring an action
             to do so.</p>
            <p><b>Single-Shot Pistol.</b> A single-shot pistol is a type of flintlock that uses bullets, requiring
             only 2 actions to be reloaded after each time it's fired.</p>
