            <h2>Protection You Wear</h2>
            <p>Armor is an adventurer’s best friend. It grants them added protection against the
             dangers they face on their travels, from the foes and monsters they fight to the various
             traps that they encounter. Without it, no group of novices could slay a roving band of 
             Goblins, no soldier could survive an onslaught of Scorched, no outpost would have any
             hope of surviving an ork assault. Simply put, anyone who goes into combat without 
             something to keep the swords, claws, and arrows away has little-to-no chance of survival.</p>
            
            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <p>There are various types of armor in I&A, and each comes with their own
             benefits and drawbacks, as shown in the table below. Certain class features will not be
             usable in certain armor types, e.g. Aetherians cannot cast spells while wearing Medium or
             Heavy armor/shields. The weight of the armor assumes the wearer is a Medium creature. 
             Light/Medium/Heavy armor takes 2/5/10 minutes to put on and take off.</p>
            <p>The type of armor you’re wearing also affects your Dodge score: none, Light,
             or Medium armor makes your Dodge score your Dodge Penalty + your AGI score + your
             DEX score, while Heavy armor makes your Dodge score your Dodge Penalty + your AGI
             score.</p>

            <h2>Armor Materials</h2>
            <p>In regards to what armor can be made of, there are 3 types of material: hide, metal and
             scale. There are 2 types of hide (beast and monster), 2 types of metal (steel and mithril), 
             and 2 types of scale (dragon and monster), for a grand total of 6 different possible armor 
             materials. In parentheses next to each type of armor are the types of materials that can be 
             used to make it, and each of the armor’s statistics, such as its Armor Bonus and Cost, give 
             only the statistics for the cheapest, simplest, most basic form of each armor (usually beast
             hide and/or steel). Materials can be bought or harvested, and a creature’s statistics in the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/BestiaryHome.html">Bestiary</a> will say what kind of material, if any, can be harvested from it. The differences and
             details of each type of material are given below, in the Armor Materials table.</p>
            <p>For the <b>Additional Cost</b>, the cost applies to the extra weight of the 
             armor if it weighs more than the base and is added to the regular cost of the
             base armor; for example, a mithril chain shirt would weigh 15 lbs. and cost 10 +
             15 (3 times 5) Aeons. If the material used weighs less than the base, calculate
             the cost as though it weighed more than the base and use that for the price. The
             cost to buy the materials for <a href="../Part6/Chapter11.html">crafting</a> can
             be found <a href="./Chapter4.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Traveling in Armor</h2>
            <p><a href="../Part6/Chapter8.html">Traveling</a>, especially on foot, is an 
             exhaustive activity. For this reason, traveling in heavier armor will exhaust
             characters far faster than traveling in lighter armor. While traveling on foot in
             Medium/Heavy armor, a character takes fatigue damage equal to 5%/10% of their 
             maximum Health (rounded appropriately, up if half) for every hour that they travel
             while wearing it.</p>
             
            <h2>Shields</h2>
            <p>Shields are always good whenever one feels they need some added protection.
             Shields come in a very wide variety of shapes, forms, sizes, and the like; however,
             for the sake of simplicity, all shields have been narrowed down to three categories
             based on their size, and each size confers a different bonus and has a different 
             cost, as shown in the table below. As with the Armors table, each shield given 
             assumes its most simple, basic form, and can be crafted or bought with different 
             materials. However, unlike armor, shields can be made of wood, which is usually
             weaker than any of the given materials. For that reason, assume each of the
             materials given above gives an additional +1 to its Armor Bonus when applied to a 
             shield.</p>
            <p>If you are wearing a Medium or larger shield, you cannot wield anything other
             than the shield in the arm wearing it and you have disadvantage on all STR and
             DEX checks involving that arm.</p>
             
            <h2>Shield Bashing</h2>
            <p>They say the best offense is a good defense, and there are those who would take
             such an axiom literally. If you wish to use your shield as a weapon, that is
             entirely doable, and the base damage for each shield is as follows: 1d4 for Small,
             1d6 for Medium, and 1d8 for Large. You must have <u>></u>3 STR to wield a Large
             shield as a weapon, and the damage for each shield scales with the Weapon Skill
             of the same name, e.g. a character with 3 proficiency in Small weapons would deal
             3d4 + their STR damage with a Small shield.</p>
