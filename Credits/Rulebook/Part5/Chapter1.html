            <h2>Aeons</h2>
            <p>The currency of Iron & Aether is the Aeon, which is a primarily fiber-based,
             paper-like currency. There are notes for 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 Aeons, and there are coins
             for 100 and 500 Aeons. There are also small copper and silver coins of varying size and
             shape that are worth less than a single Aeon, which are referred to as change, and it
             takes 100 change to make 1 Aeon. There are the same denominations of Aeon coins as there
             are Aeon notes, and they vary from a half-inch to an inch in diameter with rectangular
             and circular shapes. Shorthand for Aeons and change are simply the letters “A” and “c”,
             respectively; so 10 Aeons may be referred to as 10A, or 32 change can be referred to as 32c.</p>
            <p>The color of Aeon notes varies from light grey (1) to dark grey (50);
             the 100 Aeon coin is an inch and a half in diameter and white with a yellow tint, and
             the 500 Aeon coin is 2 inches in diameter and black. A single Aeon note is 1/1000th of
             a pound, a 100 Aeon coin and all change coins are 1/50th of a pound, and a 500 Aeon 
             coin is 1/25th of a pound.</p>
            
            <h2>Workers' Wages</h2>
            <p>To give a sense of worth to the Aeon and how various people live, described here 
             is how much workers of various wealth classes can usually expect to earn in a day:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower class: 1-1.5 Aeons</li>
                <li>Lower-middle class: 1.5-3 Aeons</li>
                <li>Middle class: 3-5 Aeons</li>
                <li>Upper-middle class: 5-8 Aeons</li>
                <li>Upper class: 10+ Aeons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The wealthy and upper-class who are not day-to-day workers may make more
             than that, but at that point it is up to your GM to determine the exact nature of their wealth.</p>
            
            <h2>Lifestyle Costs</h2>
            <p>Everyone has to eat and sleep, and it’s good to know roughly how much a meal and a night 
             in an inn is worth, especially for peoples of different wealth and social statuses.</p>

            <h2>Treasure and Quest Rewards</h2>
            <p>Knowing how the common folk live is all well and good, but what about adventurers?
             How large should the reward for a difficult quest be, or how much treasure should the 
             party expect to find inside a dungeon? Given here is a guideline for how much the party
             should reasonably expect to make from quests and dungeons for each Tier of play, though
             as always, the DM has final say.</p>

            <h2>The Price of Items</h2>
            <p>The cost of any given piece of gear or equipment is subject to an uncountable 
             number of variables, and it is impossible to accurately account for all of them and/or
             provide a single universal value for every conceivable piece of gear. Instead of 
             taking the price of anything presented in these rules as an absolute, set-in-stone
             truth, the prices given here should instead be used as a quick reference or starting
             point.</p>
            <p>When determining how much an item should cost in a particular situation, several 
             factors to consider are: the process used to make the item, the rarity of the 
             materials used and how difficult they were to acquire, and how common or easily 
             attainable that item may be. A sword that costs a few Aeons in a relatively safe 
             city with easy access to metal would be far more valuable (and therefore expensive)
             in a remote village facing a monster or bandit problem. A good shorthand is to use
             the given prices for towns that have readily available access to materials and/or
             workers, multiply the given prices by up to 2 for towns that are short on
             materials and/or workers, and multiply the given prices by down to .75 for areas 
             that are flush with materials and/or workers.</p>
             
            <h2>The Worth of Valuables</h2>
            <p>What is a diamond, really, aside from just a hard, shiny rock? In a world with
             flaming swords and people that can shoot pure darkness out of their fingers, certain
             things that we might consider valuable - precious metals and gems - would be just
             like any other metal or rock, in that their value would mostly only come from their
             usefulness, or how much value certain people(s) gave them, which is an entirely 
             arbitrary measure.</p>
            <p>Put simply, this ruleset assumes that precious metals and gems have no intrinsic
             worth or value, and see no substantial use aside from perhaps as decoration or 
             whatever more practical use they may have. Instead, Aether in all its various forms
             is likely to take their place as symbols of status, wealth, and power; picture a 
             crown inset with a pebble of each kind of Aether, or a precious family heirloom
             set with a beautifully cut "gem" of Life Aether, or some other such symbol of wealth
             that uses Aether instead of diamonds or other gems.</p>
