            <h2>Under Siege</h2>
            <p>Certain weapons are designed not for interpersonal combat, but to lay siege to a
             fortified or otherwise well-defended area, such as a fort, bunker, castle, or other such
             structure. These weapons may also be used for large-scale fights, such as skirmishes 
             between warring armies or battles against large (in both size and/or quantity) foes. 
             These weapons, not meant to be wielded by lone individuals or hauled around in the 
             dangerous dungeons and wilds oft explored by adventurers, are known as siege weapons,
             and described here are what sets them apart from normal weapons, their effects, and some
             examples.</p>
            
            <h2>What Makes a Siege Weapon</h2>
            <p>Siege weapons in Iron & Aether are in large part defined by their size, often
             being as large or larger than most Sentients (typically ranging from Medium to Huge). 
             They are also defined by their purpose: as described above, siege weapons are designed 
             for large-scale combat, breaking through castle walls or bringing down large monsters. 
             Siege weapons can sometimes be moved, but often only with special tools and the work of
             multiple Sentients, and as such are unfit for interpersonal combat, around which most of
             I&A's combat rules are designed.</p>
            
            <h2>What Sets a Siege Weapon Apart</h2>
            <p>Siege weapons deal double damage to buildings and structures unless otherwise stated. In addition, there 
             is no “Siege Weapons” skill, as the damage a Siege Weapon deals is not determined by the
             skill of any one wielder, but by the nature of its construction, e.g. the materials used
             to make it and the quality of its construction, meaning a siege weapon presented here 
             can deal more or less damage depending on the exact circumstances and nature of its 
             construction.</p>
            <p>Ranged siege weapons deal a bonus amount of damage equal to the DEX 
             score of the person in charge of firing it. Melee siege weapons deal bonus damage 
             equal to the combined STR scores of everyone wielding it.</p>
            
            <h2>Example Siege Weapons</h2>
            <p>Given here are some example siege weapons, with their size, defenses, and 
             description all given.</p>

                         one creature, however if that creature is Big or smaller, there is a
                         chance it may also pierce whatever is behind them. A ballista takes 4
                         actions to load, 2 to aim, and 2 to fire. It deals 3d10
                         physical damage, has a range of 50/200m, and does not deal

                         land a strike against a structure, dealing 1d10 physical damage for

                         4 to load, 12 to aim, and 2 to fire. It deals
