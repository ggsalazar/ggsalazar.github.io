            <center><h1>Chapter 5: Defenses</h1></center>
            <p>Whether you’re defending a caravan from bandits on the road or plundering an 
             ancient lost temple, one thing holds true between adventurers of all levels, backgrounds,
             and skillsets: a strong offense will only get you so far. Any adventurer hoping to last
             more than a day or two needs a something to defend themselves in the event things go 
             south. For some, this means being quicker than a bullet with unmatched reflexes. To 
             others, this means thick plates of metal that no Sentient’s sword nor dragon’s tooth 
             could penetrate. And for all, a weak body and mind will get you about as far as an unstrung bow.</p>
            <p>In Iron & Aether, there are 2 primary forms of defense: Dodge and Armor, both detailed
             in greater detail below. Your Armor and Dodge scores combined form your Defense 
             (DEF) and Ranged Defense (RaDEF) scores.</p>
             <p>Additionally, a creature's <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude and Willpower</a>
             protects them from poison and psychic damage respectively.</p>
             
            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <p>A character’s Armor score tells them how well-defended they are from attacks 
             that connect with their physical bodies; a low Armor score means that the gear your 
             character is wearing hardly protects them, while a high Armor score means that they 
             are quite well-defended, likely wearing thick plates of steel or something enchanted. 
             Though a high Armor score is desirable, keep in mind that heavier armor will weigh
             you down and restrain your Dodge score, as well as make it more difficult to
             <a href="../Part5/Chapter3.html">travel on foot</a>.</p>
            <p>Your Armor score is comprised of your heritage and the actual armor you are
             wearing on your body, and makes up half of your DEF score. The lowest a Sentient’s
             Armor score can be is 1.</p>
            
            <h2>Dodge</h2>
            <p>Your Dodge score - separate from the Dodge Penalty determined by your Size -
             quantifies your character’s ability to avoid immediate danger: it is a collection
             of their reflexes, defensive agility, and instinct for danger. A high Dodge score
             means that hardly anything, from a flying arrow to a swung blade, will get anywhere
             near you. Keep in mind that heavy armor and equipment will reduce and constrain 
             your Dodge score. Dodge makes up half of your DEF score, and the lowest a 
             creature’s Dodge score can be is 0. Additionally, a creature's Dodge score assumes they are
             actively avoiding danger and defending themselves; if they are doing neither of those things,
             then a character's Dodge score effectively becomes 0.</p>
            <p>Your Dodge score is determined by your <a href="./Chapter8.html">Size</a>
             and your AGI and DEX scores, and is directly modified by the armor you are
             wearing:</p>
            <p>Light, Medium, or no armor: Dodge = Size penalty + AGI score + DEX score;</p>
            <p>Heavy armor: Dodge = size penalty + AGI score.</p>
            
            <h2>Defense and Ranged Defense</h2>
            <p>The Defense (DEF) of a creature is a number that tells the player and the 
             GM how much damage is reduced from incoming melee attacks, and is determined by 
             adding the creature’s Armor and Dodge scores (DEF = Armor + Dodge); the lowest a 
             creature’s DEF score can be is 0. A creature’s Ranged Defense (RaDEF) functions
             very similarly, except that it is applied to any and all attacks made at range, 
             including explosives, ranged spells, traps, and the like. RaDEF is determined by 
             adding a creature’s DEF score to the RaDEF bonus they get from their
             <a href="./Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</p>
            <p>To find out how much damage has been dealt to a creature, take the result of the 
             attack roll and subtract the target’s DEF or RaDEF score. This damage is referred
             to as the final damage of the attack.</p>
            
            <h2>Fortitude and Willpower</h2>
            <p>In the <a href="./Chapter6.html">next chapter</a>, another type of defense 
             is covered: saves. Two of these saves, Fortitude and Willpower, also function as forms
             of defense against poison and psychic damage respectively.</p>
            
            <h2>Resistances and Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>Some creatures have resistances and vulnerabilities to certain types of damage; this
             just means that they take more or less damage from an attack that deals damage of that
             type. If a creature is resistant to an attack’s damage, then the final damage dealt to
             them by that attack is halved. If a creature is vulnerable to an attack’s
             damage, then the final damage dealt to them by that attack is doubled.</p>
