            <h2>Time to Breathe</h2>
            <p>Rests are extremely important for the physical and mental health of an adventurer,
             as they give characters time to breathe, wind down, go over any intel they may have
             gained, repair their equipment, heal and recover from their wounds, and more. In 
             I&A, there are three kinds of rests: a quick rest, a night’s rest, and a day’s rest,
             each described below.</p>
            <p>For every 24 hours that a character goes without a night's or day's rest, their 
             Maximum Health is temporarily reduced by 25%, rounded down to the nearest half, to a minimum of
             1. Each rest taken thereafter restores 25% of that character's Maximum Health.</p>
            <p><b>Quick Rest.</b> Typically lasting about an hour or so, a quick rest sees the
             party stop for a little while to collect and patch themselves up a bit.
             During a quick rest, party members are able to regain Health via rolling one of 
             their Health die (the same one they use to determine their Health when leveling up)
             and adding their CON score to the result. Quick rests <b>do not</b> restore 
             abilities that require a rest to recharge, and the benefits of a quick rest can only
             be gained twice between night's or day's rests.</p>
            <p><b>Night's Rest.</b> A night’s rest is 6-8 hours long, and usually (but not always)
             involves the party winding down, setting up camp, and taking it easy for the next
             several hours, such as via sleeping, patching themselves up, or tending to their 
             equipment. During a night’s rest, a character has their Health replenished by 50% 
             of their maximum and regains the use of any
             class features or abilities that require a rest in order to be used again. Lastly,
             despite the name, a night’s rest does not actually need to occur at night.</p>
            <p><b>Day's Rest.</b> A day’s rest is about 16-24 hours long and restores Health to full; 
             additionally, a character can perform any <a href="../Part6/Chapter10.html">downtime 
             activity</a> that they desire (provided they have the necessary resources).</p>
             
            <h2>Well-Rested</h2>
            <p>Whenever characters experience a particularly high-quality night's or day's rest 
             - such as staying in good lodgings, having a particularly delicious meal before bed, or taking a
             day to simply enjoy themselves and recover from their travels - they become 
             <b>Well-Rested</b>. A character that is Well-Rested can grant themselves advantage
             on a single roll of their choice between the end of their particularly good rest 
             and the start of their next one.</p>
            <p>When exactly a character gains this benefit is up to the GM, but some examples of
             things that would prevent a character from gaining it are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleeping in armor;</li>
                <li>sleeping outside or in low-quality lodgings;</li>
                <li>resting while suffering from a poison, disease, or madness.</li>
            </ul>
