            <center><h1>Chapter 0: Creating a Character</h1></center>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>A player’s character, referred to simply as a Player-Character (or PC), 
             is their avatar in the GM’s world. Your character represents your will and 
             influence on the world, and it is through them that you will contribute to your 
             group’s and campaign’s story.</p>
            <p>When creating a character, it is important to consider who that 
             character will be, what their role is not just in the party, but in the world as 
             well. Are they a Warrior looking to travel the world and enhance their fighting abilities?
             Are they a Rogue with a dark and mysterious past? An Aetherian looking to learn
             more about their powers? Whatever your mind comes up with, every character has an 
             incredible story just waiting to be told.</p>
            <p>When considering just how to create a character, use this chapter 
             as a guide for the actual process. Though you do not have to follow the given steps 
             in the order they are presented, it may be helpful to do so, especially for your 
             first couple of characters you make with these rules. Accompaying each step will be
             visual guides for an example character: Drea Adearie, the Human Warrior.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 1: Come up With a Concept</h2>
            <p>The first and arguably most important step of creating a character is to come up
             with a concept that you like and that you think would be fun to play. What is their             
             backstory, their goals, their fears, their vices? Do not worry if you have a hard 
             time coming up with any of these; Part 2: Backgrounds is dedicated to helping you 
             come up with aspects of your character’s personality and life story, though 
             everything presented there are mere guidelines – the bulk of creating your 
             character’s life is up to you.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step1Front.PNG" alt="Step 1 Front">
            <img src="./Drea/Step1Back.PNG" alt="Step 1 Back">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>This step is quite easy, we have simply put in Drea's name and filled out some 
             details regarding her high-level description and physical features.</p>
            <p><b>A.</b> The Character Name box, which is where the character's name goes.</p>
            <p><b>B.</b> What can be thought of as the Concept Box, this area contains most of 
             your character's high-level/conceptual information.</p>
            <p><b>C.</b> A box of physical details for your character, found at the top of the
             back of the character sheet.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 2: Determine Ability Scores</h2>
            <p>The next and possibly most vital step to creating a character is to determine
             their stats. When determining stats, you are determining each of your character’s 7
             chief <a href="./Chapter1.html">ability scores</a>: <b>Strength (STR)</b>, 
             <b>Constitution (CON)</b>, <b>Agility (AGI)</b>, <b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>, 
             <b>Intelligence (INT)</b>, <b>Wisdom (WIS)</b>, and <b>Charisma (CHA)</b>. When
             determining your character’s ability scores, two options are given here, and it is
             up to your group to decide if they will use or modify one of those or come up with 
             a method of their own.</p>
            <p><b>Roll 1d8/2 7 Times.</b> For this method, you roll 1d8, divide the roll by 2
             (don't round), and record the result; do this 7 times (once for each score), saving
             each result until you have all 7. Then, place each result into each score as you 
             desire. The main draw of this method is the possibility for very good stats, 
             however this comes at the risk of stats that aren’t as good as some other members
             of the party.</p>
            <p><b>Point Buy.</b> This method of deciding stats forgoes dice rolling in exchange
             for more centralized, fair, and consistent scores, eliminating the possibility of
             anyone having disproportionately high or low scores. With this method, everyone has
             14 points that they can use to “purchase” their ability scores using a 1:1 
             conversion rate (e.g. you can spend 2.5 points to get an ability score of 2.5); you
             cannot purchase a score higher than 4. Using this method, you can have a few high
             scores and a few low or a collection of average scores, all before applying any
             bonuses.</p>
            <p>Some of your ability scores will almost certainly be between two whole numbers,
             e.g. .5, 1.5, 2.5, etc.; for these scores, whenever you are using them to
             calculate something, such as your Health or Dodge, always round down the result.</p>
            <p>The best way to decide how to allocate ability scores, by far, is for
             the whole group of prospective players to have a meeting and decide with majority rule
             how they would like to decide their stats; does the group want the high risk, high 
             reward method of rolling for them, or the more centralized and consistent method of 
             point buy? It is best if this decision is made unanimously, but regardless, each player
             should respect the group’s will and stick to what the group decides; if they find 
             themselves unable to do this, it is recommended they find a group that more suits their
             playstyle.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step2.PNG" alt="Step 2">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>A character's ability scores are of the utmost importance, not just for 
             mechanical reasons, but because they can also inform the character's personality.
             For example, taking a look at Drea's scores (determined via rolling), we can see 
             that she is notably stronger and faster than the average person, though a bit less 
             intelligent, with average Charisma and Wisdom. Given this information, we can 
             deduce that she is likely to look for physical solutions to her problems rather 
             than intellectual or diplomatic ones.</p>
            <p>Additionally, it is important to keep in mind what you want your character to be
             good at while deciding their scores; Drea is good with an arquebus, so I have placed
             her highest score in DEX, but if I had decided to make her good with melee weapons,
             STR would also have been a good choice; she isn't meant to be a tank, so I instead made 
             her more mobile, placing her second-highest score into AGI rather than CON. The
             class list in the Part 4 <a href="../Part4/Introduction.html">Introduction</a> will
             tell you what each class' most important score(s) is/are.</p>
            <p>Lastly, although Ability Scores do improve throughout character creation, due to
             an error in creating the photos needed for this chapter, all of Drea's Ability Score
             Improvements from both her Background and her Heritage have already been applied in
             the given photos.</p>
            <p><b>A.</b> Strength (STR) is used for pushing, pulling, and otherwise exerting raw
             force using your body. It is an important stat for non-DEX-based melee characters.</p>
            <p><b>A-1.</b> For Small, Medium, and Big creatures, your carrying capacity (in 
             lbs.) is your STR score times 50.</p>
            <p><b>B.</b> Constitution (CON) is a measure of the general health and wellness of
             your body. It is a major contributor to your <a href="./Chapter4.html">Health</a>,
             which is largely determined by your class.</p>
            <p><b>C.</b> Agility (AGI) measures your speed and general bodily coordination. The
             greater your AGI, the higher your Movement, Dodge, and Reflex. <a href="./Chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a>
             will tell you how your Movement is calculated.</p>
            <p><b>D.</b> Dexterity (DEX) tells you how how quick, precise, and nimble your hands
             are. It is important for DEX-based melee fighters & ranged fighters and contributes to your Dodge and
             Reflex scores.</p>
            <p><b>D-1.</b> The number of actions you can perform on your turn, 
             determined by your DEX. <a href="./Chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a> will tell you how this number is
             calculated.</p>
            <p><b>E.</b> Intelligence (INT) quantifies your ability to think critically and 
             reason things out logically. Important for <a href="../Part4/Artificer.html">Artificers</a>,
             <a href="../Part4/Psychokinetic.html">Psychokinetics</a> and <a href="../Part4/OtherworldlyArcanist.html">Otherworldly Arcanists</a>.</p>
            <p><b>E-1.</b> Your INT score grants you extra skills and/or languages.</p>
            <p><b>F.</b> Wisdom (WIS) informs what you think you should do, as well as how in touch you 
             are with your surroundings and events occurring around you. Not important to any
             class, but the bonus to your Perception checks is quite handy.</p>
            <p><b>G.</b> Charisma (CHA) measures your presence, self-confidence, and ability to
             interact with others. Not particularly important for any classes, but a smooth
             talker is always good to have around, and it partially determines your Willpower score.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 3: Establish Baseline Skills</h2>
            <p>Every character starts with 1 <a href="./Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> in each 
             <a href="./Chapter2.html">Action Skill</a>; you will gain more further into 
             character creation and every time you level up.</p>
            <br>

            </center>
            
            <h2>Step 4: Determine and Fill Out Background</h2>
            <p>A character’s <a href="../Part2/Chapter1.html">background</a> is their life story,
             it is who they were and what they were doing up until they took up a life on the 
             road. In addition to informing part of your character's personality, your 
             background also gives you an Ability Score Improvement (ASI), a handful of skills,
             and a smattering of equipment. If you are having difficulty creating your 
             character's background, Part 2: Chapters <a href="../Part2/Chapter2.html">2</a> and
             <a href="../Part2/Chapter3.html">3</a> are dedicated to helping you do just that.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step4Back.PNG" alt="Step 4 Back">
            <img src="./Drea/Step4Front.PNG" alt="Step 4 Front">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>Drea's life prior to becoming an adventurer was that of a farmer, so I gave her
             an ASI snd skills that would reflect that life. I also decided her family's primary
             method of defending their home was an arquebus, which Drea took with her when she left.</p>
            <p><b>A.</b> The character's actual life story prior to the start of your group's
             adventures.</p>
            <p><b>A-1.</b> The skills that a character - in this case Drea - gains from their
             background: one ASI, 6 Action Skill proficiencies, 2 Weapon Skill proficiencies,
             and 2 Tool Skill proficiencies.</p>
            <p><b>B.</b> The equipment a character, specifically Drea, gains from their background.</p>
            <p><b>B-1.</b> The money that one gets from their background.</p>
            <p><b>B-2.</b> The weaponry a character gets from their background.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 5: Implement Heritage and Size Features</h2>
            <p>Next up are a character's <a href="../Part3/CreatingYourHeritage.html">Heritage</a>
             and <a href="./Chapter8.html">Size</a>, in particular the features they get from 
             both. A character's Heritage factors greatly into both mechanics and roleplay, 
             while Size is largely important for mechanics. When deciding on your Heritage,
             you can pick and choose what features and aesthetics you want or pick from/modify 
             the example Heritages given in Part 3.</p>
            <p>Additionally, if your INT score grants you extra skills or languages, now would
             be a good time to implement them.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step5.PNG" alt="Step 5">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>Seen here are the features Drea gains as both a Medium creature and as a Human.</p>
            <p><b>A.</b> Drea's Size features.</p>
            <p><b>B.</b> Drea's Human features.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 6: Fill Out Health, Defenses, Saves, and Initiative</h2>
            <p>Next up is the cluster of stats that make up the top-middle of the character
             sheet: your <a href="./Chapter4.html">Health</a> (determined by your class),
             <a href="./Chapter5.html">Defense and Ranged Defense scores</a>, 
             <a href="./Chapter6.html">save scores</a>, and your initiative bonus, which is 
             equal to either your AGI or your DEX; each stat's chapter will inform you of 
             the exact mechanics for determining them.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step6.PNG" alt="Step 6">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p><b>A.</b> Your Health is determined by your class and CON score.</p>
            <p><b>B.</b> Drea is wearing no armor but has a base Armor of 1 as a Human, and her
             Dodge is her AGI (3) + her DEX (4) - her Dodge Penalty (3), totaling 4; adding 
             these two together gives her a DEF of 5; since her RaDEF is her DEF+3, it is 8.</p>
            <p><b>C.</b> Drea's saves are calculated thusly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fortitude: STR (3.5) + CON (3) = 6.5, divided by 2 = 3.25;</li>
                <li>Reflex: AGI (3) + DEX (4) = 7, divided by 2 = 3.5;</li>
                <li>Willpower: WIS (2.5) + CHA (2) = 4.5, divided by 2 = 2.25.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>D.</b> Since Drea's DEX is higher than her AGI, I'm using it for her 
             initiative bonus. Additionally, I am assuming my GM will allow me to start with
             Drea being Well-Rested.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 7: Implement Class Features</h2>
            <p>Last step of all is to implement your chosen class' 1st-level features.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <img src="./Drea/Step7.PNG" alt="Step 7">
            </center>
            <br>
            <p>Drea is a <a href="../Part4/Warrior.html">Warrior</a>, and the only two things a
             Warrior gets at 1st level are 3 extra <a href="./Chapter3.html">Weapon Points (WP)</a>,
             2 of which I placed into Firearms and the last into Small, and their Fighting Style.</p>
            
            <h2>Complete Character Sheet</h2>
            <p>By this point your character sheet should be complete, and for reference Drea's
             completed character sheet is given here.</p>

            </center>
            
            <h2>Step 8: Starting Beyond 1st Level</h2>
            <p>Many groups start their characters off at a level higher than 1. This is not a 
             problem; simply create a character as if you were making them at level 1, then roll for
             their maximum Health appropriately, distribute their accrued <a href="./Chapter3.html">Weapon and Skill 
             Points</a>, and use the class table for your character’s class to determine what 
             features they would have at the level your group is starting at.</p>
