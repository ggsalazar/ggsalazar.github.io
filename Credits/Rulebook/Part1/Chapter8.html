            <h2>The Space of Creatures</h2>
            <p>In I&A, as in the real world, creatures are physical beings 
             that take up space, and to represent that space, every creature has a Size, 
             represented via different categories. These categories, each explained in greater 
             detail below, will indicate the size of a creature relative to other creatures, 
             the amount of space it takes up, how its carrying capacity is affected, its Base 
             Movement, the amount of fall damage that it takes, its Dodge Penalty, and its RaDEF.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that the “space” of a creature is not 
             necessarily its actual physical size, but rather more indicative of the area it 
             controls during combat. For example, Medium creatures are said to occupy roughly 1.5/5 
             cubic meters/feet of space, when a more accurate verbiage would be to say that they aware 
             of and able to strike at or otherwise meaningfully hinder anything that comes within 
             a few feet of them. This area is also needed to perform most maneuvers comfortably and 
             successfully without hindrance. It is for this latter reason that, during combat, if 
             two creatures occupy the same space, attacks made by those creatures are made with 
             disadvantage, and they may even hit each other!</p>
            <p>So, rather than say all that, it is easier to simply say a creature 
             occupies a given amount of space.</p>

                        A Tiny creature takes up practically no area whatsoever, and can almost
                         certainly be ignored, unless it is an active threat. Examples include

                        Small Sentients gain .5 to their DEX score, but lose .5 to their STR
                         score; Big Sentients, on the other hand, gain .5 to their STR but lose
                         .5 in their DEX - as always, these changes cannot go above 5 or below 0.

                        Huge creatures are giant monsters that hulk over almost everything in their path and 
                         can kill most things in a single hit – or more frequently, a single bite. Examples include 
                         Cyclops, Basilisks, and Dire Wolves.<br>

                        The penultimate Massive is gargantuan, representing creatures so huge even experienced 
                         adventurers would rather flee than face such a terror. Examples include Hydras, T-Rexes, 
                         and Quetzalcoatls.<br>

                    <br>
                        Lastly, we get to the biggest possible size categorization: Colossal. Colossal creatures 
                        are massive, titanic behemoths that, although terrifying based on their size alone, are usually 
                        extremely easy to hit, though their Armor scores may still negate any damage dealt to them. 
                        Examples include Krakens, Elder Dragons, and Behemoths.<br>
