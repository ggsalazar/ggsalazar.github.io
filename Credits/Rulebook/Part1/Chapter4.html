            <center><h1>Chapter 4: Health</h1></center>
            <p>Health is an extremely important aspect of Iron & Aether, and despite its name, is
             not necessarily indicative of a character’s physical ability to take blows; a knife to
             the heart is just as deadly at 100 Health as it is at 10. Rather, Health is a single 
             term that refers a multitude of closely-related factors that represent, more than 
             anything, a character’s willingness and ability, physically and mentally, to carry on.
             These factors include, but are not necessarily limited to: their physical durability, 
             the condition of their armor, their luck, their discipline, and their physical 
             exhaustion.</p>
            <p>This last factor, a character’s fatigue level, is especially important, as Health is
             the only measurement of exhaustion in I&A. Because of this, whenever 
             characters undergo especially exhaustive activities, such as running for a long time
             or keeping themselves afloat in turbulent waters, this will reduce Health in
             exactly the same way as taking damage from an attack would.</p>
            <p>Your Health is determined by your class and CON score; refer to your 
             <a href="../Part4/Introduction.html">class description</a> for more information.</p>
             
            <h2>Health Loss Penalties</h2>
            <p>When characters lose certain amounts of Health, they begin to suffer cumulative 
             penalties, which are lost when they regain the necessary amount of Health. These 
             penalties are described here:</p>
            <p><b>Injured.</b> When a character loses half their Health, all skill 
             checks are made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Bloodied.</b> When a character falls below 25% Health, their movement is halved.</p>
            <p><b>Death's Door.</b> If a character gets down to less than 10% of their Health, they make all
             saves and attacks with disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Enduring.</b> Finally, when a character reaches 0 Health, they are
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter4.html">Enduring</a>.
            
            <h2>Regaining Health</h2>
            <p>There are multiple ways to replenish Health:
            <ul style="margin-top:0px;">
                <li><a href="./Chapter7.html">resting</a>;</li>
                <li><a href="../Part7/Chapter3.html">Potions</a>;</li>
                <li>various spells;</li>
                <li><a href="../Part6/Chapter11.html">meals and rations</a>;</li>
            </ul>
