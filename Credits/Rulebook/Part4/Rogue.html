            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Rogue you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d8 (or 4.5) + your CON score per Rogue level after 1st</p>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You gain 2 WP to place in any Weapon Skill(s) of your choice;</li>
                <li>You gain 1 proficiency in Thieving Tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up and 1 WP at every 
             even-numbered level.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, you are extraordinarily skilled with some of your talents. Pick any
             two Action or Tool Skills that you have <u>></u> 1 proficiency in; your proficiency in 
             both of those skills increases by 1, and both of those skills can now be increased to 6,
             even if another feature says they can only be increased to 5.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, pick two more Action or Tool skills for this feature to 
             apply to.</p>
            
            <h2>Sneak Attack</h2>
            <p>Also at 1st level, you know how to take advantage of a creature’s weakness. If 
             you deal final damage on an attack that you had advantage on and was made with a 
             Small, Unarmed, or ranged weapon, you can roll 1 more of that weapon's base damage
             die and add that to the damage you deal; the number of dice you roll increases as
             you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Rogue class table. You also gain this
             benefit whenever there is a creature within 2m of your target that is an active
             threat to them and you don’t have disadvantage.</p>
            <p>You can only use this feature once per turn, and you cannot use it while wearing
            any armor that grants disadvantage on DEX checks or Medium or Large shields.</p>
            
            <h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>
            <p>Lastly at 1st level, you can speak and write Thieves’ Cant.</p>
            
            <h2>Extra Action</h2>
            <p>At 2nd level, your roguish finesse grants you two additional actions on each of your turns;
             these actions cannot be used to attack or cast.</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, you are skilled and learned enough that you start to specialize your
             talents. At the end of the class description, under “Class Feats”, you may select one 
             Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 9th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class
             feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 13th level, you may choose either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 17th level your skills are the stuff of legend, and you may
             now select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites 
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say 
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Dodge</h2>
            <p>Starting at 5th level, your ability to anticipate and avoid incoming danger is 
             unsurpassed. From now on, when determining your Dodge, double your AGI 
             and DEX scores.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Reflexes</h2>
            <p>By the time you hit 7th level, your ability to save yourself from incoming harm is
             extraordinary. From now on, when determining your Reflex save, do not divide the 
             sum of your AGI and DEX by 2; if you already gain this benefit from another source,
             your Reflex save instead increases by another 2.</p>
            
            <h2>Honed Skill</h2>
            <p>At 11th level, your skills are starting to become unmatched. From now on, whenever
             you make any sort of skill check, if one of the die you rolled come up as a 1, you can
             reroll one of them once. This feature stacks with other abilities that give similar benefits.</p>
            
            <h2>6th Sense</h2>
            <p>Starting at 14th level, you cannot be surprised, and so long as you can see and 
             hear, you automatically know the location of any being within 3m of you, so long as
             they are not hidden from you.</p>
            
            <h2>Slippery Mind</h2>
            <p>When you hit 15th level, your sharp mind grants you added protection against 
             mental intrusion. From now on, do not half the sum of your mental scores when 
             determining your <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower score</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Elusive</h2>
            <p>At 18th level, you’re very difficult to hit. From now on, attacks against you 
             that would have advantage become normal attacks.</p>
            
            <h2>Reliable Luck</h2>
            <p>Finally, at 20th level, your uncanny luck seems to always have you covered. 
             Whenever you make any kind of skill check or attack with a weapon that has the DEX 
             property, if you fail the check or deal no final damage, you can roll again and use 
             either result.</p>
            
            <h1>Rogue Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Rogues are tricksters, clever combatants, and capable skill monkeys, and their 
             class feats enhance their tricks and wits and give them more options to obtain their 
             goals. Some focus on their skills, enhancing their ability to aid their groups outside
             of combat, while others enhance their combat prowess and Sneak Attacks, making 
             themselves the most feared combatant on the battlefield.</p>
