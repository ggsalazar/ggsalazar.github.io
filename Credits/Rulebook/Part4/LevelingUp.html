            <center><h1>Leveling Up</h1></center>
            <p>Leveling up is a term that refers to the act of a PC reaching a certain threshold
             in their adventuring career that sees them gain more power and expertise in their 
             chosen method of adventuring. Higher level characters are quantifiably stronger and
             more durable than lower-level ones, with more Health, abilities, and skills at 
             their disposal.</p>
            
            <h2>Methods of Level-Up</h2>
            <p>There are two methods of leveling up given here, though if a group agrees that 
             neither of these methods work best for their playstyle, then they are encouraged to 
             come up with their own. Regardless of what method your group chooses, PCs should 
             ideally level up once every 3-4 sessions: long enough to enjoy and get used to the
             powers they gain at each level, but not so long as for gameplay to become stale and
             stagnant.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column" style="margin-left:7.5%; margin-right:2.5%; width:40%;">
                    <button type="button" class="grid">Milestone</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                    <br>
                        The first method of level gaining is referred to as the Milestone method. With 
                         this method, the characters gain a level whenever the GM feels the players have made
                         significant progress in the current arc of their campaign, such as discovering a
                         major plot point or defeating a powerful enemy.
                    <br><br>

                </div>
            
                <div class="column" style="margin-right:7.5%; margin-left:2.5%; width:40%;">
                    <button type="button" class="grid">Session Count</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                    <br>
                        The other method of leveling up sees the PCs gaining a level at the 
                         start or end of every certain number of sessions that the GM determines
                         (e.g. every 1, 2, 3, or more sessions) regardless of whether anything
                         significant has occurred or not.

            <h2>Advancing Beyond Level 20</h2>
            <p>Some players may wish to continue playing with their characters even after 
             reaching level 20, even though there are no longer any class features to gain from doing
             so. If your party agrees to do this, it is important to consider methods of rewarding 
             characters for their continued advancement: they may gain things like lands and titles 
             from governments they’ve served, continue to increase their ability scores, learn extra
             feats, take levels in other classes, or something else entirely.</p>
             
            <h2>Multi-Classing</h2>
            <p>Any time a character gains a level – so long as they are not already level 20 
             (unless the GM says otherwise; see “Advancing Beyond Level 20” above) – they can 
             take a level in any class other than the one they started in. When doing this, they
             gain the 1st-level features in that class described in the class table, but must
             roll for their increased Health and do not gain any SP or WP normally granted to
             that class at character creation; instead, they gain the usual 1 SP, and 1 WP if 
             their total number of levels is even-numbered (or, in the case of multi-classing 
             into <a href="./Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>, if their total number of levels is a
             multiple of 4).</p>
            
            <h2>Minutia</h2>
            <p>When a character levels up, there are a handful of things the player needs to 
             remember to do. The first and simplest task is to increase their Health; this can be 
             done using the die referred to in the <b>Health Beyond 1st Level</b> section of the 
             class description of that character’s class. If you are taking or have taken a level in
             a different class than the one you started with, then use the die for the class you are
             increasing your level in. For example, if your character has 3 levels in <a href="./Rogue.html">Rogue</a>
             and you wish to take a level in <a href="./Warrior.html">Warrior</a> at
             your next level up, then you would roll 1d10 + your CON score to determine the Health
             you gain from leveling up. If, at the next level after that, you decide to take another
             level in <a href="./Rogue.html">Rogue</a>, then you would increase your
             Health by 1d8 + your CON score (it is recommended that GMs allow their players to 
             reroll Health rolls of 1 at least once per level up).</p>
            <p>Secondly, each class gains 1 SP at every level and 1 WP at every even-numbered 
             level to distribute as they wish, except for <a href="./Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a>
             who only gain 1 WP every 4 levels, starting at level 4.</p>
            <p>Third and lastly, each class gains the features described in their 
             class table appropriate to the level they have reached.</p>
             
            <h2>The Tiers of Play</h2>
            <p>As characters grow, learn, and gain experience adventuring, the challenges they 
             face should scale proportionately. These challenges are referred to as Tiers, and are 
             measured from 0 – 6, with 0 being small and insignificant threats and 6 being extremely
             major and catastrophic threats. Each Tier has a suitable level range, which assumes that
             the party is composed of 4 characters of the same level of differing classes.</p>
