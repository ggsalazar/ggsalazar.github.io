            <p>Warriors, as their name would imply, are easily the best fighters in all of I&A,

             than once, even if you get to pick another later.</p>

            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, you have become practiced enough in the art of combat that you have
             learned to enhance your talents with special abilities. At the end of the class 
             description, under “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>

             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 18th level your battle prowess is demigod-like, and you may
             now select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites 
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say 
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>
            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you’ve learned how to give your attacks special 
             flavors. From the following list, you may select any 3 abilities and use them in 
             combat, following any restrictions detailed in the ability’s description. You have
             a number of uses for your maneuvers as shown in the Warrior class table; you regain
             all of these uses at the end of a night's or day's rest, and regain 1 use at the 
             end of a quick rest. You can use only one maneuver per attack or reaction. You can
             select 3 more maneuvers at 10th and 15th level.</p>
            <p><b>Combat Dodge.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you 
             can use your reaction to move 2m and double your Dodge score until the start of your
             next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Commander's Strike.</b> You can use an action to command a single 
             ally within 10m of you that you can see to use their reaction to make an attack 
             against an enemy of your choice, provided they have a means of attacking them without 
             moving.</p>
            <p><b>Disarming Blow.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt the
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Disarm</a> action as part of your attack.<br>
            <p><b>Disorienting Blow.</b> When you make an attack, 
             you can make a DEX check contested by the target's <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude 
             save</a>; on a success, the are <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">stunned</a>
             until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Distancing Strike.</b> If you deal final damage with an attack, 
             you can move up to 1/4 your movement as part of the same action without provoking an 
             Opportunity Attack from the creature that you damaged.</p>
            <p><b>Distracting Strike.</b> When you deal final damage with an attack, 
             for the next minute the next attack against your target from a creature other than you has 
             advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Lunge.</b> When you make a melee attack, your range extends by 2m for that attack.</p>
            <p><b>Menacing Blow.</b> When you make an attack, you can
             make an Intimidation check contested by the target's <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower
             save</a>; on a success, they are <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a>
             of you until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Parry.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to add
             your proficiency with one of your equipped weapons to your Armor score until the start
             of your next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Pinning Strike.</b> Whenever you make an attack against a creature,
             you can also attempt the <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Pin</a> action
             as part of your attack.</p>
            <p><b>Quickdraw.</b> When the GM calls for initiative rolls, you can add 10 to your roll in
             addition to your normal initiative bonus.</p>
            <p><b>Redirect.</b> When a creature targets you with a melee attack, you can use
             your reaction to make the attack target another creature within 2m of you.</p>
            <p><b>Riposte.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you can use
             your reaction to strike back at them once.</p>
            <p><b>Shoving Attack.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt the 
            <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Shove</a> action as part of your attack.</p>
            <p><b>Sweeping Strike.</b> When you make a melee attack, you can target an
             additional creature with the same attack so long as the second creature is within 
             2m of both you and the original target. Roll the damage for the attack only
             once.</p>
            <p><b>Trip Attack.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt the 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Trip</a> action as part of your attack.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Resolve</h2>
            <p>When you reach 6th level, your fighting spirit is able to keep you going at even
             the worst of times. Once between rests, you can choose to reroll a save of any kind and
             use either result. You can do this twice between rests at 10th level, and thrice at 
             14th level.</p>
            
            <h2>Advanced Weapons Training</h2>
            <p>At 9th level, your skill with weapons surpasses nearly all of your peers. You gain
             an extra Weapon Point, and can increase a single Weapon Skill of your choice to 6. At 
             17th level, you gain this benefit again.</p>
            
            <h2>Indomitable</h2>
            <p>Finally, at 20th level, it is almost impossible to take you down. You can now use
             your Second Wind feature 6 times between rests, it can be done using a single action, and it
             restores 2d12 + your CON score Health.</p>
            
            <h1>Warrior Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Every Warrior, as they train, reaches a point of proficiency at which they start
             to learn relatively unique abilities. Some channel their fighting spirit into a sort of
             rage or focus that enhances their fighting power, while others hold back and observe 
             their enemies’ weaknesses and plan accordingly, while others learn how to better wield a
             firearm. In any case, every single Warrior is a powerhouse, a force to be reckoned with,
             and a deadly and capable combatant.</p>
