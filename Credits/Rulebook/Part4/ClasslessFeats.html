            <p>Classless feats, which can be taken in lieu of Ability Score Improvements, serve
             as a way to give your character unique abilities or enhance their existing ones in some

                        <i>Prerequisite: Dual-Wielding</i>
                        <br><br>
                        You have trained and practiced with large, two-handed weapons, allowing you to 
                         carry and swing them with ease. So much ease, in fact, that you are able to wield 
                         two of them at once, one in each hand. This feat allows you to dual-wield weapons 
                         with the Two-Handed property, or wield them with one hand, leaving your other hand
                         free. In order to wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, your STR must be <u>></u>1
                         more than the STR requirement of the weapon; additionally, when wielding a 
                         two-handed weapon in one hand, the magnitude of the base damage die is reduced by 1,
                         e.g. a d8 would become a d6.

                        Your body is toned, tough, and resilient to anything that might harm it.
                         From now on, do not half the sum of your STR and CON scores when 
                         determining your <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude score</a>;
                         if you already gain this benefit from another source, your Fortitude

                         now on, do not half the sum of your AGI and DEX when determining your

                        Select a single Weapon Skill that you have </u>></u>5 proficiency in and that is
                         not a class feature; you have learnt to wield those weapons as though
                         they are extensions of your own body, granting you the following
                         benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your proficiency in that skill increases to 6 if it wasn't already;</li>
                            <li>Whenever you make an attack with that weapon, if you roll a 1 on any of the 
                             damage dice, you can reroll one of them once and must use the new result.</li>
                        </ul>
                        If you choose Firearm, Small, Throwing, or Unarmed, you gain the following as well:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firearm: You can now reload Firearm weapons in half the time, rounded down if necessary;</li>
                            <li>Small: You gain an additional action on each of your turns
                             that can only be used to attack with Small weapons;</li>
                            <li>Throwing: You gain an additional action on each of your turns
                             that can only be used to attack with Throwing weapons that deal <u>&#60;</u> 1d4 base damage;</li>
                            <li>Unarmed: Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 + your STR score physical base 
                             damage unless otherwise stated by another feature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        You can take this feat multiple times.
