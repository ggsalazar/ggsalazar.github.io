            <h2>The Power of the Mind</h2>
            <p>Psychokinetics manipulate objects, energies, and even the minds of those around
             them through disciplined practice, study, and meditation. Through their own minds, they
             are able to bend and shape reality to their will, from throwing objects about the room
             to hypnotizing their enemies into fighting for them.</p>
            <p>Most Psychokinetics achieve their power through sheer study, practice,
             and force of will, usually training underneath a powerful and accomplished Psychokinetic
             looking to pass their skills on. Others are born naturals at it, finding themselves able
             to pick up toys several decimeters away as toddlers or sense the emotions of those around them
             before even reaching adolescence.</p>

            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Psychokinetic you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d6 (or 3.5) + your CON score per
             Psychokinetic level after 1st</p>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 WP to place in any Weapon Skill of your choice.</p>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up and 1 WP at every
             even-numbered level.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Energy Manipulation</h2>
            <p>All Psychokinetics are able to exert a degree of influence over the energies in their
             immediate environment, either increasing or decreasing the raw power of the forces around them.
             For the purposes of this feature, you gain 1 proficiency in an Exotic weapon henceforth referred
             to as “Energy”, which you gain further proficiency in as you gain levels in this class, as shown
             in the Psychokinetic class table. Within the span of a single minute, you have a number of uses
             for this Energy equal to half your Psychokinetic level (rounded up) + your Energy proficiency;
             you regain a use one minute after expending it. If you have no uses remaining, you can still
             perform an Energy-related action, however you take 10 true damage each time you do.</p>
            <p>Whenever an attack is made within 10m of you or by you that deals burn, 
             electric, freeze, physical, or sonic damage, you can use your reaction to roll a
             single d6 and increase or decrease the damage dealt by that attack; if the attack
             is made by you, increasing/decreasing the damage dealt is considered part of your
             attack and does not use your reaction. As your proficiency with Energy increases,
             the number of d6s you roll increases proportionately, just like with normal
             weapon attacks.</p>
            <p>Because of the fine movements required, you cannot use your Energy while 
             wearing any armor that grants disadvantage on DEX checks or Medium or Large 
             shields.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Psycho Save DR</b></h2>
            <p>Certain Psychokinetic features require a creature to make a save against something
             you do. This save is determined via your INT score, since your abilities are derived 
             from your understanding and knowledge of the forces in the world around you.</p>
            <p><b>Psycho Save DR</b> = your Psychokinetic level + quadruple your INT score</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>Once you hit 2nd level, the power within your mind has grown enough that you have
             learned to enhance it with special abilities. At the end of the class description, under
             “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 11th level, you may select either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>At 15th level your psychic powers are near-legendary, and you may now 
             select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two 
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Entropic Redirection</h2>
            <p>At 5th level, you have learned not just to increase or decrease the energies 
             around you, but also how to manipulate them for your own purposes, turning the 
             destructive powers of your enemies against them. From now on, whenever you use 
             Energy to decrease damage, you can then store and redirect that damage onto another
             creature or object.</p>
            <p>To do this, once you use Energy to reduce damage from an attack, record the amount and type of
             damage that you reduce. Thereafter, you can apply this damage to any weapon attack made by you
             (no action required) or within range of your Energy that you can see, which uses your reaction;
             in either case, you must decide to apply the damage before the attack is rolled, and you can expend
             a use of Energy to amplify the damage being done just as you could with a regular attack. 
             Once you apply this damage, the stored energy is expended. Any energy that you have stored lasts
             a number of minutes equal to your Energy proficiency, and at the end of that time the energy is lost.</p>
            <p>As an example, let’s say you store 14 points of burn damage from an attack 
             directed at you; on your next turn, you decide that as part of one of your attacks, you would
             like to inflict this damage on another creature. In addition to the regular damage of your attack,
             you would then add this 14 points of burn damage. If you chose to expend a use of Energy to amplify
             this attack, you would also roll 3d6 and add that to the damage you deal.</p>
            <p><b>Creative Redirection.</b> Consider how you can use your Entropic Redirection
             feature creatively, or what outside-the-box uses it might have. For example, if you
             store freeze damage, perhaps you can redirect it into water to freeze the water? 
             Or perhaps you store electric damage and can use it to jump-start an electric
             machine? Work with your GM to see what creative uses you can find for this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Second Reaction</h2>
            <p>You've become incredibly efficient at storing and redirecting the Energy in your environment,
             enough so that at 7th level you are quick enough of mind and body to gain a second reaction.</p>
            
            <h2>Improved Energy Manipulation</h2>
            <p>By the time you have reached 9th level, your ability to manipulate the energies 
             in your immediate environment has greatly improved. From here on out, your Energy
             now has a range of 20m and, whenever you roll to increase or decrease the
             amount of damage dealt by an attack, you can now add your INT score to the roll.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Energy and Entropy</h2>
            <p>At 20th level, your Energy has its range is extended to 30m and its base 
             damage die is increased to 1d8, meaning you roll 6d8 whenever you use Energy
             Manipulation.</p>
            
            <h1>Psychokinetic Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Psychokinetics learn to focus their practices into a myriad of abilities, from 
             energy blades to telekinesis to telepathy. These abilities are presented here as class
             feats, which may be chosen at levels 2, 6, 11, and 15. However they choose to enhance 
             their powers, every Psychokinetic is an incredible powerhouse and an impressive force
             to be reckoned with.</p>

                         weapon of pure psychic energy, so long as you have <u>></u> 1 proficiency with that
                         weapon's type; you could also expend two Energy uses to summon it using only 1
                         action. Damage with this weapon uses your proficiency with that weapon’s type,
                         e.g. if you summon a dagger and have 3 proficiency in Small weapons, that dagger
                         deals 3d4 + your STR/DEX physical damage. If you conjure a weapon that requires
                         ammunition, such as a revolver, you can summon up to 10 pieces of ammunition as part
                         of the same action, and must use an additional action to summon
                         up to 10 more; you can have up to 20 extra pieces of ammunition in this way
                         (physical ammunition can still be used with your conjured weapon). The weapon is a
                         color of your choice, translucent, and lasts for as long as you are concentrating on
                         it (as though concentrating on a spell). Only you can wield this weapon, and it
                         disappears whenever you lose physical contact with it (except ammunition, which
                         disappears after it hits or misses). Lastly, while the weapon is summoned, the number
                         of Energy uses at your disposal decreases by 1.

                        Taking this feat allows you to manipulate the matter in your environment
                         using only your mind. Using this feature, you are able to move as many
                         objects within 10m of you that you can see as you wish, so long 
                         as their combined weight in pounds does not exceed 50 times your
                         Psychokinetic level. You <b>cannot</b> lift living creatures or sentient
                         constructs, including yourself, nor can you use this feature while 
                         wearing armor or shields that impose disadvantage on DEX checks due to
                         the fine movements required.<br>
                        <br>
                        If the object you are trying to manipulate is currently being worn or
                         carried by another creature, they must make a STR check against your 
                         INT check to resist having the object pulled away from them.<br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, whenever you make a STR or DEX check or perform an Action Skill that would 
                         normally require the use of your STR or DEX, you can instead choose to use your INT 
                         instead as you manipulate an object telekinetically rather than manually, so long as
                         it makes sense for you to be able to do so; for example, you could make a STR or 
                         Sleight of Hand check this way, but not a Swim or Stealth check.<br>
                        <br>
                        When manipulating objects using your Telekinesis feature, there are 3 types of
                         manipulation you can perform on an object at any one time: Fine Control, Throw, and
                         Destruction, which are explained here:<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Fine Control.</b> Fine control is used whenever you perform simple actions with an
                         object you are holding using your Telekinesis feature. Non-combat examples include
                         using a key on a lock, gently moving or rotating an object in such a way that does 
                         not deal damage, opening doors, etc. During combat, you can exert fine control on an
                         object as if you were wielding it as a melee weapon, however doing so costs 1 use of
                         Energy for every 2 actions that you perform with a weapon wielded telekinetically,
                         and you are considered to be concentrating on wielding the telekinetic weapon as though
                         you were concentrating on a spell. Attacks are mechanically the same as normal,
                         however instead of your STR or DEX, you must now use your INT, and you use your INT 
                         instead of your DEX when determining the number of
                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">actions</a> at your disposal when wielding 
                         weapons telekinetically.<br>
                        <br>
                        Though you can hold more than one object at once using this feature, you can only
                         exert fine control over one object at a time.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Throw.</b> Throwing an object simply means you are using an action to launch
                         it up to a distance equivalent to the range of your Telekinesis - even if it goes 
                         beyond the range of your Telekinesis - in a direction of your choosing. Objects 
                         thrown in this way deal 1d6  + your INT base damage scaled to your Energy 
                         proficiency.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Destruction.</b> You can use an action (based on your INT score instead of your 
                         DEX) and expend a use of Energy to apply raw telekinetic force to an object, dealing
                         damage to it through sheer force of will and intellect alone; when you do this, make
                         an Energy attack against the object in question, adding your INT score to the roll
                         (e.g. 2d6 + INT at 2nd level), and measure that against the object's RaDEF. An 
                         object reduced to 0 Health in this way is destroyed.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>At Higher Levels.</b> The range and weight limit of this feature
                         increases as you level up: at 6th level, they become 15m and 75
                         times your Psychokinetic level, respectively; at 11th level, they 
                         increase to 22m and 100 times your Psychokinetic level; and at
                         15th level, they become 30m and 150 times your Psychokinetic level.

                         equal to 3 times your Psychokinetic level. This channel can be one

                        In addition, you can use 2 actions to read the surface thoughts or

                    <br><br>
                        Your Telekinesis has grown and developed to allow you to use 2 actions and
                         a use of your Energy
                         (or two on especially dense objects) to reshape the objects you control,
                         such as warp a sword or sharpen a blunt rock. To do this, you must 
                         already be controlling the object telekinetically. You cannot reshape 
                         an <i>artifact</i>-level enchanted item unless it is already moldable.

                        You have become proficient enough at moving inanimate objects that you are now 
                         able to exert control over living creatures as well. Your ability to control living
                         creatures follows the same restrictions as controlling objects; however, whenever 
                         you attempt to control a creature using your Telekinesis, it must make a 
                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude or Willpower save</a>
                         against your Psycho Save DR. On a failed save, it is controlled by you as if it were
                         an inanimate object. If you attempt to directly harm the creature (such as tearing 
                         off limbs or crushing organs), it must make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude

                         to do to it. Damaging non-vital organs or appendages deals 2d8 true damage, and
                         ripping off appendages causes the External Bleeding

                        At 15th level, you have learned to fundamentally alter a creature’s worldview 
                         using the power of your mind, and in doing so effectively enslave it. Pick one 
                         creature that you can touch; that creature must make 2 <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower saves</a>
                         against your Psycho Save DR as you use the next minute to attempt to enslave it; one
                         save at the start of the process, and one at the end. During this time, you are both
                         <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">incapacitated</a>, and if you take
                         any damage or are otherwise violently disturbed, your trance ends and they 
                         automatically succeed on their second save. If they pass either of these saves, or 
                         if your trance is interrupted during this time, nothing happens, they are aware of
                         what you tried to do, you cannot attempt to enthrall them again for another 15 days,
                         and you cannot attempt to enthrall any other creature for 24 hours.<br>
                        If they fail both of these saves, they become your thrall and are
                         considered <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">charmed</a> by you. 
                         They now follow your every order to the letter, including attacking any creatures 
                         they were previously allied with, but not including deliberately hurting or killing
                         themselves. You are always aware of your thrall’s distance and direction from you,
                         can read their every thought, and can always communicate with them telepathically,
                         all regardless of distance, so long as you are both on the same plane.<br>
                        If you or one of your close allies attacks your thrall, and once 
                         every 48 hours after becoming enthralled, they can make another <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower save</a>,
                         and on a success are no longer enthralled by you; if this happens, you are aware of it
                         immediately, as well as your former thrall’s last known distance and direction from
                         you if it was on the same plane as you when the effect ended. The effect also ends 
                         if you so choose. You can have only one thrall at a time; if you wish to gain a new
                         thrall while you already have one, you must end the effect on that one and take a
                         day’s rest.

                        This feat allows you to change up to 10 minutes of a creature’s memory. To do this,
                         use 4 actions to pick a single creature within range of your Telepathy, who
                         must then make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower save</a> against your
                         Psycho Save DR. On a success, they know what you are trying to do and can choose to
                         let you modify their memory or not. On a failure, they are unaware of what you are
                         doing, and you can select any 10 minutes of their memory and modify it as you see 
                         fit, inserting or removing aspects at your discretion. This change is permanent 
                         unless you later choose to un-modify it, which requires the same process. This can
                         be performed once between night's or day’s rests.
