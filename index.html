                <h3>A retro-inspired 2D dungeon crawler with mild roguelike elements</h3>
                <h4>June 2nd, 2024</h4>
                <p>From here on out, I intend to update this blog on the first Sunday of every month in perpetuity, giving details on the progress of what I've worked on for the past month, and what I intend to work on in the coming month.<br>
                To start, in November of last year, I started working on a project called <i>Frosveld</i>, an open-world dungeon crawler heavily inspired by the oldest of the old-school RPGs, in the vain of DnD, Alkalabeth, Wizardry, and others.
                I needed something I could work on that would cost me little-to-no money while I got my finances in order, and I decided to challenge myself to release 2 games in 2024, of which I wanted <i>Frosveld</i> to be one. Unfortunately,
                it seems I may have overscoped a bit, and may have to put off releasing <i>Frosveld</i> until early 2025, seeing as I want to release a game for the Christmas season, so that will be the focus of the later months of the year. I
                believe to retain a 2024 release date for <i>Frosveld</i>, I may very well have to grind myself into dust.</p>
                <p>That being said, I do intend to continue working on it until the planned release date, most of the reason being that working on it has been an exceptionally educational experience for me. Ugly as the game might be, I have learnt
                so much about developing game systems I had never previously touched on before, and grown my own capabilities as a programmer and game developer far beyond what they were previously. Even if I were to not make a single red cent off
                of <i>Frosveld</i>, my time spent on it will not have been in vain when taking into account my own personal growth and all that I have learned.</p>
                <p>So, by the time the next blog update comes around, I intend to have all abilities, leveling up, dungeon layouts, and world persistence all fully functioning, as well as a logo for the game and pictures and gifs of all of this.</p>
                <p>Thank you, and I'll see you in a month!<br>
