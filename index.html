                    Wassup bitches?!?! Not too much to report on today, just that I've cut my break a couple months short and am back in the full swing of coding, which unfortunately means Iron & Aether is back on the backburner. Currently in the throes of figuring out
                    how to build an engine in C++, really just kind of doing some practice projects to learn the foundational aspects before I transition into working on a proper game of my own. Very exciting! And, at times, frustrating.

                    Good evening! My apologies for missing the second update of October, evidently my calendar was not set to alert me on every other update. But that isn't too important, as I am still in the middle of my "break".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In keeping with that, I don't have much news besides that I have a pretty solid idea of what I want to start working on in the new year, and that some big I&A updates are on their way in the next couple months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See y'all in a couple weeks!<br>

                <p>
                    Howdy y'all! My apologies for missing the second update of September, I'm not sure how that happened. But in any case, I have some big announcements for y'all, so strap in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first announcement is that I will be taking a break from digital game development for the rest of the calendar year, as I realized I was severely burnt out and game development was no longer making me happy by any stretch. Rather,
                    my primary focus during this time will be burning through as much of my backlog as possible, reassessing my relationship with game development, and deciding how I would like to proceed forward with it when I do start doing it again.
                    I'll also be taking this time to prioritize resolving some personal matters that will relieve a massive weight off my shoulders; once all these things are taken care of, I should be in a much better state mentally overall, and my passion
                    for game development will be reignited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also during this time, I've decided to focus my creative energies on Iron & Aether, in particular patching up the website to be more user-/mobile-friendly and help making the onboarding of new players easier, as well as the usual
                    balance, gameplay, and wording adjustments. To this end, I recently had an extremely informative playtesting session with some friends of mine, so look forward to changes big and small over the coming months!
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all for now,<br>
                    Griffin G. Salazar

                    What's up GAMERZ?!?!1? It's ya boi G.G. Salazar here coomin' at you live with another sort-of-bi-weekly-but-not-really update on my little indie horror game that isn't progressing as fast as I would like despite my
                    best efforts. To follow up on the last update, I've managed to get lights working! They come in various fovs, sizes, and colors, and their edges are mighty soft! Have a look for yourself:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="./Screenshots/Lights1.PNG" width="384" height="216" alt="Lights1">
                    <img src="./Screenshots/Lights2.PNG" width="384" height="216" alt="Lights2">
                    <img src="./Screenshots/LightsDemo.gif" width="384" height="216" alt="LightsDemo">
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may notice upon close inspection that unfortunately, none of those lights are casting shadows, and that is next on the agenda. From there, I should be able to go back to working strictly on gameplay mechanics.
                    And I will say, while this has been an exceptionally educational experience and I have learnt a great deal, goddamn do I hate working on shaders, and probably graphics in general. Gameplay and AI mechanics I just
                    find to be much more engaging on some level - I can't really explain it. So yeah, once shadows are puzzled out, development will feel a lot less like slamming my head into a brick wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Iron & Aether side of things, last week I pushed an update that made a great deal of improvements, changes, and "bug fixes", for lack of a better term, and later today I plan to push another, much smaller
                    but still quite important update; this one will update Chapter 0, the one that teaches you how to make a character, and will reflect both the recent changes to the character sheet and all the changes to the rules
                    that have been enacted in the months (years?) since C0 was last updated. I hope anyone playing the game enjoys and finds it helpful!

                    Howdy gang. Not much to report this time around; progress on <i>TDW</i> has slowed while I piece together baby's first lighting system, which I would like to believe will be among this project's biggest challenges,
                    but I'm not so foolish as that. In any case, it's progressing, just not as quickly as I would like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other news, I've decided that I would dedicate my weekends to working on Iron & Aether, as the recent edits I made reminded me of just how much I enjoy working on it. I still haven't the faintest idea how to
                    market the damned thing, but that isn't important to me; I enjoy I&A for its own sake. Would I enjoy it if other people also enjoyed it, and expressed that enjoyment via supporting me financially? Yes,
                    absolutely. But in the meantime, I've gotten good at appreciating things for their own sake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all for now. Until next time, lads.<br>

                <h4>August 4th, 2024</h4>
                <p>
                    Progress on <i>The Darkness Within</i> is coming along well! Still in the prototyping and basic mechanics phase, but certain mechanics are taking me a lot less time to implement than I had initially thought they
                    would, which I'm choosing to interpet as a good sign. Honestly, it's surprising just how much of the work I did on <i>Frosveld</i> is transferring almost 1:1 to this project; the work I did on it then has really
                    been a massive time-saver so far. In any case, hopefully two weeks from now I'll have some half-way decent pictures and gifs to post on here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of half-way decent visuals, I don't know when I'll be able to afford an artist to make the game actually aesthetically pleasing or a sound designer to design the sounds, but my current plan has me reaching
                    out to publishers towards the end of this year/start of next year, so hopefully by then, if all goes well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I was recently perusing the rules for <i>Iron & Aether</i>, as I am wont to do on occassion, and noticed several errata in the Aetherian class that demanded fixing, so there's a new patch out today that mostly
                    focuses on that. I hope anyone playing the game enjoys!
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's pretty much it for this update guys. Thanks again, see you in a couple weeks!<br>

                <h4>July 22nd, 2024</h4>
                <p>
                    After a great amount of reflection, I've decided that developing <i>Cemetary Sentinels</i> would not be a worth-while effort. This is because I strongly believe that it would not be successful, and is extremely unlikely to even
                    get published in the first place. Additionally, and just as if not more importantly, I am utterly sick of working on games that have no story and have nothing to say. <i>Iron Guard</i>, <i>Frosveld</i>, <i>Cemetary Sentinels</i> -
                    I want to be a game developer because I want to tell stories, so why haven't I been doing that?.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it's time for that to change. <i>The Darkness Within</i> is going to be different from all of my previous projects: it will have passion and inspiration behind it, and will be the first of the stories I tell through video games.
                    My current goal now is to get a polished demo up and running - roughly the first third of Chapter 1 - and then use that to find a publisher or crowdfund development. With any luck, that will happen by the end of this year, and then the
                    game will hopefully be done in Q4 of 2025 - hell, a Halloween release would be perfect, but I'm not planning on that. This is easily the biggest project I've ever undertaken, and I wouldn't be surprised if hoping for a 2025 release turns
                    out to be unrealistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, I'm really excited to be working on this, to finally be making a game with real substance, to finally be <i>telling a story!</i> I hope anyone reading this is just as excited as I am. While the game is being developed,
                    I'll be sharing my progress on here, and keeping y'all updated on how things are going behind-the-scenes, such as when I find an artist or if circumstances prevent me from working for however long.
                </p>

                <h2>Current Project: Cemetary Sentinels</h2>
                <h3>A Plants vs. Zombies-inspired 2D autobattler about spirits attempting to break out of a cemetary</h3>
                <h3>
                    Projected Release Date: October 28th, 2024
                    <h4>July 7th, 2024</h4>
                    <p>
                        As you might be able to tell, development of <i>Frosveld</i> has been cancelled. The primary reason for this is that, as it turns out, I am one degree of separation from the head of the indie horror publishing studio DreadX!
                        In light of this news, I have decided to completely refocus my efforts for the month of July into putting together a prototype/demo for a Halloween-themed game in the hopes of securing funding for it. This project - <i>
                            Cemetary
                            Sentinels
                        </i>, as you might have guessed - is one I've had circulating in the back of my brain for a while now, and I had originally intended on releasing it for Halloween of 202<b>5</b>; however, I will gladly take this opportunity
                        to move my plans forward a full year! In the event this fails, I have another horror project in mind that is much less time-sensitive, and that I'm positive I could secure funding for should, again, a working prototype be produced.
                        To be perfectly honest, I feel rather foolish for not pursuing getting funding from a publisher much sooner. For so long I'd been adverse to the idea of working with one, this whole time believing that going fully grassroots with
                        self-funding and Kickstarter to be the only - or at least, the best - way to go. And while that can definitely still happen in the future, with the benefit of this new perspective, I think pursuing the aid of an established publisher
                        is definitely the better option, at least for now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, before work on this project can begin in earnest, I've come to a stark realization: <i>Iron Guard</i> needs to be fixed. It is my only released game of any note (not counting <i>Iron & Aether</i> of course), and it is a buggy mess.
                        I am firmly of the belief that any publisher who takes a look at it would be a fool to place any stock in me or my capabilities, and I would be hard-pressed to quell their doubts. So, while I do believe there are flaws inherent in the
                        design of <i>Iron Guard</i> that will prevent it from ever being a stand-out game, that doesn't mean I can't take a few days to fix the more superficial flaws, and make myself appear that much better by association. Ergo, that will be the
                        first order of business, and then work on <i>Cemetary Sentinels</i> can truly get started.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, I've decided it would be prudent to update this blog on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, instead of just the 1st.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you, and I'll see you in two weeks!<br>

                    <h2>Current Project: Frosveld</h2>
                    <h3>A retro-inspired 2D dungeon crawler with mild roguelike elements</h3>
                    <h4>June 2nd, 2024</h4>
                    <p>
                        From here on out, I intend to update this blog on the first Sunday of every month in perpetuity, giving details on the progress of what I've worked on for the past month, and what I intend to work on in the coming month.<br>
                        To start, in November of last year, I started working on a project called <i>Frosveld</i>, an open-world dungeon crawler heavily inspired by the oldest of the old-school RPGs, in the vain of DnD, Alkalabeth, Wizardry, and others.
                        I needed something I could work on that would cost me little-to-no money while I got my finances in order, and I decided to challenge myself to release 2 games in 2024, of which I wanted <i>Frosveld</i> to be one. Unfortunately,
                        it seems I may have overscoped a bit, and may have to put off releasing <i>Frosveld</i> until early 2025, seeing as I want to release a game for the Christmas season, so that will be the focus of the later months of the year. I
                        believe to retain a 2024 release date for <i>Frosveld</i>, I may very well have to grind myself into dust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, I do intend to continue working on it until the planned release date, most of the reason being that working on it has been an exceptionally educational experience for me. Ugly as the game might be, I have learnt
                        so much about developing game systems I had never previously touched on before, and grown my own capabilities as a programmer and game developer far beyond what they were previously. Even if I were to not make a single red cent off
                        of <i>Frosveld</i>, my time spent on it will not have been in vain when taking into account my own personal growth and all that I have learned.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, by the time the next blog update comes around, I intend to have all abilities, leveling up, dungeon layouts, and world persistence all fully functioning, as well as a logo for the game and pictures and gifs of all of this.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you, and I'll see you in a month!<br>
