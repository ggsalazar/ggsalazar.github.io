            <h2>Unnatural Abilities</h2>
            <p>Mutants are Sentients who have undergone specific medical, alchemical, or arcane 
             procedures – voluntarily or otherwise – that have left them with enhanced speed, 
             strength, reflexes, and a bevy of other enhanced skills and abilities. Though they gain
             much, their abilities do come at a cost: Mutants age twice as quickly as normal, and can
             never again return to how they once were. Despite this, many Mutants welcome their new
             powers, or at the very least put them to very good use.</p>

            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Mutant you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 12 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d12 (or 6.5) + your CON score per
             Mutant level after 1st</p>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain 1 proficiency in Alchemy Supplies, up to 5;</li>
                    <li>Select one Weapon Skill to gain proficiency in as you level up.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Fearless</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, your mutated nature grants you greatly increased confidence and 
             bravery, granting you advantage on all saves against being <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Infrared Vision</h2>
            <p>The alterations to your body grant you the ability to see in the thermal spectrum,
             granting you infrared vision if you did not already have it.</p>
            
            <h2>Mutations</h2>
            <p>Lastly at 1st level, you gain what sets you apart from a normal Sentient: your
             Mutations, strange alterations to your body that grant you special abilities. You have 1
             Mutation at this level, and gain more as you level up, as shown in the Mutant class 
             table. Over the course of a night’s rest, you are able to change out one of your 
             Mutations for another. Over the course of a day’s rest, you can change all of your
             Mutations if you so desire.</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>When you reach 2nd level, the changes in your body have matured enough that they
             have started to grant you more specialized abilities. At the end of the class 
             description, under “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 7th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 13th level, you may choose either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 18th level your body is barely that of a Sentient anymore,
             and you may now select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one 
             Journeyman and two Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites 
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Dodge</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, your ability to anticipate and avoid incoming danger is unsurpassed.
             From now on, when determining your Dodge, double your AGI and DEX scores.</p>
            
            <h2>Improved Physiology</h2>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, your abnormal body grants you advantage on saves against 
             poison and disease.</p>
            
            <h2>Feat and Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1 or two of them by .5, as well as take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Reflexes</h2>
            <p>At 5th level, your ability to save yourself from incoming harm is extraordinary, increasing
             your Reflex score by 1, up to 6; if your Reflex was already 6, then the bonus to it becomes the
             sum of your AGI and DEX, rather than just the larger of the two.</p>
            
            <h2>Tireless</h2>
            <p>Your enhanced body tires far less easily, making you resistant to fatigue damage 
             at 6th level.</p>
            
            <h2>Veins of Poison</h2>
            <p>At 9th level your blood and saliva become toxic to others. If a creature ingests
             your blood or saliva or is bitten by you, they take 1d8 base poison damage scaled to your 
             CON score, dealing an extra 1d4 if your CON is x.5 (e.g. if your CON is 3.5, they take 3d8 +
             1d4 + 3.5 poison damage). If they take <u>></u>5 final damage from this poison, they become
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> for the next minute, or only 30 seconds if they took <u>&#60;</u>4 final damage. Except for their next turn, 
             they can repeat this save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early.</p>
            
            <h2>Backup Mutagen</h2>
            <p>You have learned how to keep a single Mutation in reserve just in case. Starting 
             at 14th level, once between rests, you can take one minute to swap out one of your
             Mutations for another. This backup Mutation must be decided at the end of your last rest,
             and over the course of a night’s rest you can change your backup Mutation as well as one
             of your active Mutations.</p>
            
            <h2>Final Form</h2>
            <p>You are a Mutant unlike any other, more powerful and capable than nearly all of 
             your kind. At 20th level you are able to keep 2 backup Mutations instead of 1, and 
             changing from one of your active Mutations to one of your reserve ones now requires only
             6 seconds (independent of your DEX) instead of a full minute. Over the course of a night’s rest, you can alter 
             both of your backup Mutations in addition to one of your active ones.</p>
            
            <h1>Mutant Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">The reality of a Mutant’s very existence is that they are unnatural, they are 
             freaks who have been twisted by experimentation into something beyond any Sentient. But
             this does not have to be a bad thing: many Mutants put their enhanced physique and 
             skills to good use. The Mutant class feats help Mutants to achieve this, and make them
             more powerful than they already are.</p>

                        This feat allows you to improve one of your active 
                         Mutations, using the <b>Amplified</b> form of the Mutation as
                         given in its description. If you have more than one active
                         Mutation, you must decide which one you are amplifying at the
                         end of each night's or day's rest.
