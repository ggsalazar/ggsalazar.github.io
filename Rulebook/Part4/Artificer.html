            <p>Artificers are savants when it comes to machines and mechanics, using their genius
             to build amazing creations out of wires, gears, and whatever else they can get their 
             hands on. Their creations are incredible boons both in and out of combat, but their true
             strength is in their ingenuity and creativity.</p>

             the same way you could use those tools to replenish the Health of an <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automaton</a>.
             If your Artifice is lost or destroyed, you can spend 50 Aeons in materials and use your
             Tinkering Tools to build a new one over a dayâs rest.</p>
            <p>Your Artifice will be upgraded at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, unless you decide
             to create another at one of those levels.</p>
            
            <h2>Artifice Charges</h2>
            <p>At creation, your Artifice has a single charge that you can expend to perform a special ability unique to it, detailed here:</p>
             
            <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <div class="column">
                    <button type="button" class="grid">Creature</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                    <br>
                        The creature can expend a charge and take 1.5 seconds to make a special attack against a single 
                         target; this attack deals 1d8 + its CON score electric damage. If this attack
                         deals any final damage, the target loses its reactions until the start of its 
                         next turn. The number of d8s rolled increases as you gain more Artifice charges,
                         as shown in the Artificer class table.

                    <br>
                        You can expend a charge to either <b>a.</b> perform a jump that is double
                         your normal jump height/distance or <b>b.</b> double your speed 
                         for the next 6 seconds.

                    <br>
                        The Turret can expend a charge to perform a special flamethrower attack that takes 
                         the form of either <b>a.</b> a 10m line or <b>b.</b> a 5m cone (pick which at the
                         time you make the attack); in either case, the inferno deals 1d8 + your INT score
                         burn damage to every creature caught in its area of effect and takes 3.5 seconds. The
                         number of d8s rolled increases as you gain more Artifice charges, as shown in the 
                         Artificer class table.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>You replenish your Artificeâs charges during a nightâs or day's rest. Your Artifice gains
             more charges as you level up, as shown in the Artificer class table.</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>At 2nd level, you studied and tinkered enough to learn how to enhance yourself and
             your Artifice with special feats. At the end of the class description, under âClass 
             Featsâ, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 11th level, you may choose either one Expert, one Journeyman and one
             Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 17th level your genius is the stuff of legend, and you may now select one
             Master, one Expert and one Journeyman, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two Novice, or
             four Novice class feats.</p>
            
            <h2>Tool Expertise</h2>
            <p>When you reach 3rd level, your skills with your tools are unmatched. Pick any two
             Tool Skills with which you have <u>></u> 1 proficiency; your proficiency in both of those 
             skills increases by 1, and both of those skills can now be increased to 6, even if 
             another skill or feature says it can only be increased to 5. If you only have proficiency
             in one Tool Skill, then pick any other Tool Skill of your choice for this feature to apply to.</p>
            
            <h2>Feat and Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1 or two of them by .5, as well as take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Artifice Upgrade</h2>
            <p>At 5th, 10th, and 15th level, you have spent enough time researching, learning, 
             and experimenting with and on your Artifice to upgrade it, culminating in your Magnum 
             Opus at 20th level. An Artifice must be upgraded in order, and cannot obtain an upgrade
             of a given level if it has not obtained the next-lowest upgrade, e.g. you cannot give
             your Artifice its 3rd-level upgrade if it has not acquired its 2nd-level upgrade. If 
             your Artifice is lost or destroyed after obtaining its level 1/2/3 upgrade, it can be
             rebuilt using your Tinkering Tools, 100/250/500 Aeonsâ worth of materials, and a dayâs
             rest.</p>

            <h1>Artificer Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">An Artificer is an inventor, a mechanic possessing rare genius that allows them to
             make their own incredible mark on the world. These feats help Artificers to make that
             mark, giving their inventions and Artifices their own unique styles, perks, and flavors,
             or expanding upon their other inventions.</p>

                         Earth, Fire, or Water Aether into them, your explosives gain the following
                         benefits:<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Air.</b> Your explosive blows creatures caught in its area
                         of effect back by 4m; if a creature collides with anything other than the 
                         ground in its flight, it takes 1d10 additional damage of the appropriate type.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Earth.</b> Your explosive deals an additional 2d6 physical
                         damage as solid chunks of rock and stone explode out of it.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Fire.</b> Your explosive deals an additional 2d6 burn or electric
                         damage: if you chose burn, the radius of its area of effect increases
                         by 2m; if you chose electric, enemies who take final damage must
                         succeed on a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude save</a> against twice the final damage they took or
                         lose their reaction(s) until the start of their next turn.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Water.</b> The burn damage your explosive deals is replaced by 
                         freeze/physical damage, as the eruption of hot gases is replaced by a
                         burst of intense cold and ice shards.<br>

                        Using this feat, you are able to combine two of your Artifices into a single
                         mechanism, granting the new machine capabilities truly unique to it. You can 
                         make the following combinations:<br>
                        <b>Creature and Exoskeleton.</b> You permanently affix the 
                         Exoskeleton to the Creature, which then gains its benefits.<br>
                        <b>Creature and Turret.</b> Youâve managed to permanently affix the Turret to the
                         Creature, allowing the Creature to fire the Turret as though it were the user, or 
                         for a rider to be the user; for the purposes of firing the Turret, the Creature
                         gains 3 proficiency in Firearms.<br>
                        <b>Exoskeleton and Turret.</b> The Turret permanently becomes 
                         one of the Exoskeletonâs equipped weapons, and it no longer requires any time
                         to place, though it does require 1.5 seconds to activate/deactivate, and while 
                         activated that arm cannot be used for anything other than the Turret; additionally,
                         this means that no one other than you can use the Turret, but otherwise, you can now
                         use the Turret as normal. Unfortunately, since the Turret has been re-engineered to
                         be smaller and lighter, its base damage is reduced to 1d8, and the magnitude of
                         the flamethrower damage is also reduced by 1, i.e. 1d6 base damage becomes 1d4,
                         1d10 becomes 1d8, etc.

                        Youâve managed to create a mechanical and scientific means of something
                         that was previously only possible via the arcane: teleportation! With
                         this feat, youâve managed to tinker together a short-range,
                         single-person teleporter that allows the user to take 3 seconds (independent of their DEX) to 
                         instantly transport themselves to an unoccupied space that they can see
                         within 10m.

                        Your command of explosives is unparalleled, allowing you to amalgamate 
                         Quintessential Aether into your pyrotechnics. Using a Â½ pound of Dark, Light, 
                         Space, or Time Aether, your explosives gain the following benefits:<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Dark.</b> In addition to the damage it deals, your explosive
                         also creates a globe of pure impenetrable darkness of a size equal to its area 
                         of effect; this globe lasts for the next minute. Since this is arcane darkness,
                         creatures cannot see through it without arcane aid, such as special enchanted 
                         items or spells that grant arcane sight.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Light.</b> Your blast creates a globe of radiant light, with
                         a radius of bright light equal to the area of effect and an equal radius of dim
                         light beyond that. Creatures caught in the area of effect of the bright light 
                         are <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">blinded</a> until the end
                         of their next turn; since this is arcane light, this effect cannot be avoided
                         except by arcane means. This globe lasts for the next minute.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Space.</b> The distance that this explosive can be tossed is
                         doubled, as is its area of effect.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Time.</b> The explosion causes all creatures who took final
                         damage from the blast to become <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">slowed</a>
                         for the next minute.<br>
                        <br>
                        You must decide which Aether you integrate at the time you 
                         make the explosive.-->
