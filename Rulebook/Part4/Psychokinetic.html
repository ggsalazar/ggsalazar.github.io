            <h2>The Power of the Mind</h2>
            <p>Psychokinetics manipulate objects, energies, and even the minds of those around
             them through disciplined practice, study, and meditation. Through their own minds, they
             are able to bend and shape reality to their will, from throwing objects about the room
             to hypnotizing their enemies into fighting for them.</p>
            <p>Most Psychokinetics achieve their power through sheer study, practice,
             and force of will, usually training underneath a powerful and accomplished Psychokinetic
             looking to pass their skills on. Others are born naturals at it, finding themselves able
             to pick up toys several decimeters away as toddlers or sense the emotions of those around them
             before even reaching adolescence.</p>

            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Psychokinetic you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d6 (or 3.5) + your CON score per
             Psychokinetic level after 1st</p>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b> Select one Weapon Skill to gain proficiency in as you level up.</p>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Source</h2>
            <p>All Psychokinetics are able to exert a degree of influence over the energies in their
             immediate environment, either increasing or decreasing the raw power of the forces around them.
             For the purposes of this feature, you gain 1 proficiency in an Exotic weapon henceforth referred
             to as “Source”, which you gain further proficiency in as you gain levels in this class, as shown
             in the Psychokinetic class table. The amount of Source at your disposal is equal to your 
             Psychokinetic level + your INT score rounded down, and you regain 1 Source per minute. If you
             have less Source remaining than the amount needed for what you want to do, you can still perform
             the action, however your available Source is reduced to 0 and you take 10 true damage for every
             deficit point of Source.</p>
            <p>Whenever an attack is made within 10m of you or by you that deals burn, electric, freeze,
             physical, or sonic damage, you can use your reaction and expend 1 Source to roll a
             single d6 and increase or decrease the damage dealt by that attack; if the attack
             is made by you, increasing/decreasing the damage dealt is considered part of your
             attack and does not use your reaction. As your proficiency with Source increases,
             the number of d6s you roll increases proportionately, just like with normal
             weapon attacks.</p>
            <p>Because of the fine movements required, you cannot use Source while 
             wearing any armor that grants disadvantage on DEX checks or Medium or Large 
             shields.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Source Save DR</b></h2>
            <p>Certain Psychokinetic features require a creature to make a save against something
             you do. This save is determined via your INT score, since your abilities are derived 
             from your understanding and knowledge of the forces in the world around you.</p>
            <p><b>Source Save DR</b> = 5 + your INT score + your Source proficiency + your Psychokinetic
             level</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>Once you hit 2nd level, the power within your mind has grown enough that you have
             learned to enhance it with special abilities. At the end of the class description, under
             “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 11th level, you may select either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>At 15th level your psychic powers are near-legendary, and you may now 
             select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two 
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Feat and Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1 or two of them by .5, as well as take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Entropic Redirection</h2>
            <p>At 5th level, you have learned not just to increase or decrease the energies 
             around you, but also how to manipulate them for your own purposes, turning the 
             destructive powers of your enemies against them. From now on, whenever you use 
             Source to decrease damage, you can then store and redirect that damage onto another
             creature or object.</p>
            <p>To do this, once you use Source to reduce damage from an attack, record the amount and type of
             damage that you reduce. Thereafter, you can apply this damage to any weapon attack made by you
             (no time cost) or within range of your Source that you can see, which uses your reaction;
             in either case, you must decide to apply the damage before the attack is rolled, and you can
             expend 1 Source to amplify the damage being done just as you could with a regular attack. 
             Once you apply this damage, the stored energy is expended. Any energy that you have stored lasts
             a number of minutes equal to your Source proficiency, and at the end of that time the energy is
             lost. You can store only one type of energy in this way, and if you attempt to store another
             the first energy type is lost; you can still, however, enhance/reduce damage from other attacks,
             you just can't store that damage for later use.</p>
            <p>As an example, let’s say you store 14 points of burn damage from an attack 
             directed at you; on your next turn, you decide that as part of one of your attacks, you would
             like to inflict this damage on another creature. In addition to the regular damage of your
             attack, you would then add this 14 points of burn damage. If you chose to expend 1 Source to
             amplify this attack, you would also roll 3d6 and add that to the damage you deal. Alternatively,
             you could hold onto the stored damage for a little while and attempt to absorb more burn damage
             from another attack or other source, making the eventual release of the stored-up energy that much
             more powerful.</p>
            <p><b>Creative Redirection.</b> Consider how you can use your Entropic Redirection
             feature creatively, or what outside-the-box uses it might have. For example, if you
             store freeze damage, perhaps you can redirect it into water to freeze the water? 
             Or perhaps you store electric damage and can use it to jump-start an electric
             machine? Work with your GM to see what creative uses you can find for this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Second Reaction</h2>
            <p>You've become incredibly efficient at storing and redirecting the energy in your environment,
             enough so that at 7th level you are quick enough of mind and body to gain a second reaction.</p>
            
            <h2>Improved Source</h2>
            <p>By the time you have reached 9th level, your ability to manipulate the energies 
             in your immediate environment has greatly improved. From here on out, your Source
             has a range of 20m and, whenever you roll to increase or decrease the
             amount of damage dealt by an attack, you can now add your INT score to the roll.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Source</h2>
            <p>At 20th level, the range of your Source is extended to 30m and its base damage die is 
             increased to 1d8, meaning you roll 6d8 whenever you increase or decrease the damage around
             you.</p>
            
            <h1>Psychokinetic Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Psychokinetics learn to focus their practices into a myriad of 
             abilities, from energy blades to telekinesis to telepathy. These abilities are presented here as
             class feats, which may be chosen at levels 2, 6, 11, and 15. However they choose to enhance 
             their powers, every Psychokinetic is an incredible powerhouse and an impressive force
             to be reckoned with.</p>

                         of you that you have been to before, and you can see and hear anything up to 10m 
                         away from that point. If you are personally familiar with a creature or object, you
                         can use this feat to locate and spy on them and their immediate surroundings so long
                         as they are within a number of kilometers <u>&#60;</u> your Psychokinetic level. It
                         costs 1 Source per minute to maintain this projection, and you do not regain Source
                         during this time.

                        With this feat, you can use 2 seconds and expend 1 Source to conjure a
                         weapon of pure psychic energy, so long as you have <u>></u>1 proficiency with that
                         weapon's type; you could alternatively expend 2 Source to summon it instantly.
                         Damage with this weapon uses your proficiency with that weapon’s type,
                         e.g. if you summon a dagger and have 3 proficiency in Small weapons, that dagger
                         deals 3d4 + your STR/DEX physical damage. If you conjure a weapon that requires
                         ammunition, such as a revolver, you can summon up to 10 pieces of ammunition as part
                         of the same summoning, and must use an additional 2 seconds and 1 Source to summon
                         up to 10 more; you can have up to 20 extra pieces of ammunition in this way, though
                         physical ammunition can still be used with your conjured weapon. The weapon is a
                         color of your choice, translucent, and lasts for as long as you are concentrating on
                         it (as though concentrating on a spell). Only you can wield this weapon, and it
                         disappears whenever you lose physical contact with it (except ammunition, which
                         disappears after it hits or misses). Lastly, while the weapon is summoned, the amount
                         Source at your disposal decreases by 1.

                        Taking this feat allows you to manipulate the matter in your environment
                         using only your mind. Using this feature, you are able to move as many
                         objects within 10m of you that you can see as you wish, so long 
                         as their combined weight in pounds does not exceed 50 times your
                         Psychokinetic level. You <b>cannot</b> lift living creatures or sentient
                         constructs, including yourself, nor can you use this feature while 
                         wearing armor or shields that impose disadvantage on DEX checks due to
                         the fine movements required.<br>
                        <br>
                        If the object you are trying to manipulate is currently being worn or
                         carried by another creature, they must make a STR check against your 
                         INT check to resist having the object pulled away from them.<br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, whenever you make a STR or DEX check or perform an Action Skill that would 
                         normally require the use of your STR or DEX, you can choose to use your INT 
                         instead as you manipulate an object telekinetically rather than manually, so long as
                         it makes sense for you to be able to do so; for example, you could make a STR or 
                         Sleight of Hand check this way, but not a Swim or Stealth check.<br>
                        <br>
                        When manipulating objects using your Telekinesis feature, there are 3 types of
                         manipulation you can perform on an object at any one time: Fine Control, Throw, and
                         Destruction, which are explained here:<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Fine Control.</b> Fine control is used whenever you perform simple actions with an
                         object you are holding using your Telekinesis feature. Non-combat examples include
                         using a key on a lock, gently moving or rotating an object in such a way that does 
                         not deal damage, opening doors, etc. During combat, you can exert fine control on an
                         object as if you were wielding it, however doing so costs 1 Source
                         for every 2 actions that you perform with a weapon wielded telekinetically,
                         and you are considered to be concentrating on wielding the telekinetic weapon as though
                         you were concentrating on a spell. Attacks are mechanically the same as normal,
                         however instead of adding your STR or DEX to the damage dealt by your attacks, you now add your INT. Though you can hold
                         more than one object at once using this feature, you can only
                         exert fine control over one object at a time.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Throw.</b> Throwing an object simply means you are using 1 Source and expending
                         1 second (independent of your DEX) to launch it up to a distance equivalent to the range of your Telekinesis
                         - even if it goes beyond the range of your Telekinesis - in a direction of your 
                         choosing. Objects thrown in this way deal 1d6  + your INT base damage scaled to 
                         your Source proficiency.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Destruction.</b> You can expend 1 second (independent of your DEX) and 1 Source to apply raw telekinetic
                         force to an object, dealing damage to it through sheer force of will and intellect
                         alone; when you do this, make a Source attack against the object in question, 
                         adding your INT score to the roll (e.g. 1d6 + INT at 2nd level), and measure that
                         against the object's RaDEF. An object reduced to 0 Health in this way is destroyed.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>At Higher Levels.</b> The range and weight limit of this feature
                         increases as you level up: at 6th level, they become 15m and 75
                         times your Psychokinetic level, respectively; at 11th level, they 
                         increase to 22m and 100 times your Psychokinetic level; and at
                         15th level, they become 30m and 150 times your Psychokinetic level.

                        With this feat, you can use 3 seconds (independent of your DEX) and expend 2 Source to create
                         a barrier of pure telekinetic energy, warding off most things that would attempt to
                         pass through it. The bounds of this barrier cannot exceed the range of your
                         Telekinesis, and it lasts a number of minutes equal to double your INT
                         score or until you dismiss it (no time cost). This barrier is completely transparent,
                         30cm thick, can be any shape that you choose, and can have up to 300 square meters 
                         of surface area (so it can be a wall 6 meters
                         high and 15 meters long, a sphere roughly 6 meters in diameter, a cube
                         with a face length of just over 3 meters, etc.). Creatures targeted by
                         ranged attacks originating from the opposite side of the barrier have
                         their RaDEF increased by an amount equal to your Source Save DR. A 
                         creature attempting to get through the barrier must succeed on a STR 
                         check against your Source Save DR to do so. At the end of the barrier's duration,
                         you can expend 1 more Source to keep it going
                         for another amount of minutes equal to double your INT score (no time cost).

                         of your mind. Using 1 second (independent of your DEX) and 1 Source, you can create an amount of sonic,
                         kinetic, electric, or heat (or lack thereof) energy to deal a flat 10 points of
                         corresponding damage, which is immediately stored as though you had gained it from an external

                         energy in this manner, however each 10-point amount of energy requires another

                         against your Source Save DR as you use the next minute to attempt to enslave it; one

                         themselves. You are always aware of your thrall’s distance and direction from you,
                         can read their every thought, and can always communicate with them telepathically,
                         all regardless of distance, so long as you are both on the same plane.<br>
                        If you or one of your close allies attacks your thrall, and once 
                         every 48 hours after becoming enthralled, they can make another <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower save</a>,
                         and on a success are no longer enthralled by you; if this happens, you are aware of it

                         you if it was on the same plane as you when the effect ended. The effect also ends 
                         if you so choose. You can have only one thrall at a time; if you wish to gain a new
                         thrall while you already have one, you must end the effect on that one and take a
                         day’s rest before you can attempt to create a new thrall.
