            <h2>Spells</h2>
            <p>A spell is a special arcane effect produced by the inherent power of the casting
             Aetherian, or of the power imbued into whatever enchanted item the caster is 
             wielding. Spells usually produce some sort of visible and immediately noticeable 
             effect, though this is not always the case.</p>
            
            <h2>Perceiving a Spell Being Cast</h2>
            <p>All spells require movement of some kind, usually some sort of somatic allegory for what the 
             spell is trying to do, e.g. when casting the spell <i>Burst</i> an Aeromancer might forcefully
             push their hands out in a mimicry of what the spell is doing, or a Tempomancer might use their 
             hands to wind back the arms of a spectral clock when casting <i>Rewind</i>. Because of these 
             movements, an Aetherian cannot cast spells while wearing Medium or Heavy armor or Medium or 
             Large shields. If an Aetherian wishes to cast a spell subtly so as not to be noticed doing so, 
             they can make a Sleight of Hand check contested against the other party’s Perception check.</p>
            
            <h2>Spell Traits</h2>
            <p>Every spell has a collection of traits which detail specific and important 
             aspects of the spell: <b>Mana Cost</b>, <b>Casting Time</b>, <b>Range</b>, 
             <b>Damage</b>, <b>Save</b>, <b>Duration</b>, <b>Area of Effect</b>, and <b>Notable
             Effects</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Mana Cost (M.C.).</b> The amount of Mana the caster must expend to unleash the spell’s
             power; the caster’s maximum Mana must be <u>></u> to the Mana Cost of a spell for them to be
             able to cast it at all. When casting a spell, the caster must subtract the Mana Cost of the
             spell from their remaining Mana; if the M.C. of the spell is > their remaining Mana, they can
             still cast it, however their Mana will be reduced to 0 and their current Health will be depleted
             by 5 times the remaining difference. Additionally, a spell's M.C. can be reduced by 1 by 
             doubling the casting time; to determine the casting time of a spell whose M.C. you are reducing
             in this way, you need only use the formula x(2<sup>y</sup>), where x is the spell's original
             casting time and y is the amount you want to reduce the M.C. by.</p>
            <p><b>Casting Time (C.T.).</b> How long it takes for the spell to be cast, assuming the caster's DEX is &#60;2. If a spell has a
             casting time, then the caster cannot take any other actions while casting or the casting will 
             fail, however they can re-aim the spell at any point during the casting. Until the casting is
             complete, the caster is considered to be concentrating (see <b>Duration</b> below) on the spell.</p>
            <p><b>Range (Rng.).</b> How far away from the caster’s current position the origin 
             point of the spell can be placed/the target(s) can be; the caster must have
             line of sight on the origin point/target in order to cast the spell. If the caster
             has line of sight but cannot actually see the origin point/target, then the damage
             of the spell may be rolled with disadvantage, or if the spell requires a save, the
             target can make it with advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Damage (Dam.).</b> The type of damage (if any) a spell deals; spells deal 1d8 base
             damage and scale to the caster's Aether proficiency, with a bonus equal to the caster's INT, WIS, or CHA (chosen at the time they become an Aetherian). For example, if a spell says it deals burn damage
             and the caster has 3 Aether proficiency and uses their INT for bonus damage, then the caster rolls 3d8 +their INT and measures that against the
             target's (Ra)DEF. Aetherians are immune to damage from their own spells, however the wielders of spellcasting items are not.</p>
            <p><b>Save.</b> What type of save, if any, is needed; saves are always made against the caster's
             Aether Save DR. If more than one type of save is listed (e.g. Fort./Ref.), the caster decides
             which save the target makes. The effects of failing the save will be given in <b>Notable Effects</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Duration (Dur.).</b> How long the spell can last. Spells with the <b>Concentration</b> tag as part of their duration require the caster’s constant
             focus, and being attacked can cause the caster to lose focus, ending the spell prematurely. If the caster takes damage while casting a spell with the <b>Concentration</b>
             tag, they must make a Willpower save against twice the final damage dealt; on a failure, the spell ends. A caster can have only one Concentration-tagged spell going at a
             time.</p>
            <p><b>Area of Effect (AoE).</b> Detailed below.</p>
            <p><b>Notable Effects (Efcs.).</b> What will happen inside the spell’s AoE/to its targets. Unless stated otherwise, Aetherians are immune to the Effects of their own spells,
             however the wielders of spellcasting items are not.</p>
            
            <h2>Areas of Effect</h2>
            <p>A spell’s <b>Area of Effect (AoE)</b> gives the shape of the spell, as well as 
             the dimensions of that shape. Each shape has a point of origin, or a spot from
             which the spell’s power and energy erupts. The direction into which it erupts is 
             usually up to the caster, though some spells default to the direction the caster is
             facing.</p>
            <p>The shape and dimensions of a spell’s AoE is specified in its description, and 
             the different possible shapes (and their respective points of origin) are given 
             here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>cone</b> has length and width and the point of origin is at the tip;</li>
                <li>A <b>cube</b> has the length of the faces and the point of origin is in the
                 middle of one face;</li>
                <li>A <b>cylinder</b> has diameter and length and the point of origin is on one
                 face;</li>
                <li>A <b>line</b> has length (and sometimes height), is assumed to be 
                 1 meter wide, and the point of origin is at one end;</li>
                <li>And a <b>sphere</b> has diameter and the point of origin is in the exact 
                 center.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead of a shape, a spell may specify a number of targets for the spell to 
             affect. In this case, the spell’s description will specify what the targets must be
             and how many of them there can be. A creature will usually not know it has been 
             targeted unless the spell produces some sort of perceivable effect, though some
             spells, such as an Animancer’s <i>Read Thoughts</i>, are not typically perceivable
             unless the spell’s description says otherwise.</p>
             
            <h2>Improving Spells</h2>
            <p>Spells can be improved at the cost of additional Mana: typically, a spell’s 
             <b>Range</b>, <b>Damage</b>, <b>Duration</b>, and <b>AoE</b> are what can be 
             improved. Some spells are exceptions to the guidelines given here and will specify
             in their descriptions if that is the case. The amount of extra Mana the caster can spend to 
             improve a spell is equal their Aetherian level, e.g. a 3rd level Luxomancer can only spend
             up to 3 Mana improving the <i>Fireball</i> spell.</p>
            <p><b>Range.</b> If a spell does not have a range of “Touch” or “Self”, then its 
             range can be extended by 3 meters for every 1 extra Mana spent.</p>
            <p><b>Damage.</b> A spell’s damage can be improved at the cost of 1 Mana per 
             additional d8.</p>
            <p><b>Duration.</b> When extending a spell's duration, the caster can expend 1 Mana at the end of
             the spell to keep the spell going for half of the original duration, e.g. at the end of a 1
             minute spell, the caster can spend 1 Mana to keep the spell going for another 30 seconds. This
             applies to all durations except "Instant", which cannot be extended at all.</p>
            <p><b>Area of Effect.</b> To extend a spell’s AoE by 1 meter in a single
             dimension (such as making a cone 1m wider or a line 1m longer) costs 1 
             Mana. For target spells, additional targets can be selected at the cost of 2 Mana
             per target.</p>
             
            <h2>Creating Spells</h2>
            <p>The spells any given Aetherian has access to are many and varied. However, the
             imaginations of players are infinite, and it is almost certain that you or another
             player may want to cast a spell that is not listed. While the various aspects of 
             the spell may be easy to come up with, determining the Mana Cost of a new spell may
             seem like a strange and esoteric practice; thankfully, however, this is not the 
             truth. Determining a spell's Mana Cost is (mostly) quite easy and can be done by
             following this table (assume the cost of the spell starts at 0):</p>

            <p>The table given here should mostly be used as a guideline to give you a
             foundation to start with, rather than an absolute. If you believe your spell should
             cost a little bit more or less than the value you arrived at, then feel free to
             adjust it as you feel is necessary, just be certain to clear the spell with your
             GM.</p>
            
            <h2>Spell Traps</h2>
            <p>Any spell that does not have the "Concentration" tag and does not have a range of
             "Self" can be set as a trap. When it is, the spell becomes a glyph, or a circular
             collection of arcane runes, symbols, and energy that faintly glow with the spell’s
             power and which must be 15cm - 1m in diameter. A glyph cannot be disarmed
             or dispelled by any ordinary means, though when set off, the energy of the glyph is
             expended and it disappears. If a spell set as a trap has a range, it targets itself;
             if it requires a target to be selected, the target is whoever triggered the glyph;
             and if it has a direction for the AoE, that direction is the direction the glyph is
             facing.</p>
            <p>There are 4 steps to setting a spell as a trap:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The caster casts the spell as normal;</li>
                <li>They designate a surface or small object that they can touch to embed the 
                 power and effects of the spell into;</li>
                <li>They spend the casting time of the spell imbuing the spell’s power into that
                 surface or object;</li>
                <li>They set the conditions for the spell trap to trigger, e.g. touching the
                 spell glyph, moving the object the glyph is placed on, opening the book the
                 glyph was placed in, etc. All spell traps have the following conditions:
                 <b>1. if the glyph is moved 3m from where it was placed, the spell goes 
                 off</b>, and <b>2. the glyph lasts 6 days by default, but its lifespan can be 
                 extended by 6 days for every 2 extra Mana spent on it at the time it was
                 created.</b></li>
            </ol>
            <p>To spot a glyph, a creature can make an Arcana or Perception check against what 
             the caster’s Aether Save DR was at the time they made the glyph, and to determine
             what spell the glyph contains, the creature can either be the same type of
             Aetherian as the one who set the trap or succeed on an Arcana check against what 
             the caster’s Aether Save DR was at the time they set the trap.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Otherworldly Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>The vast majority of spellcasting in Iron & Aether is done by either Aetherians 
             or enchanted items; however, there exists in the I&A ruleset extradimensional and
             otherworldly forces, and it is not unheard of for these forces, these beings, these
             Others, to find their way into an I&A-based world. These Others bring with them 
             their own arcane abilities and powers, and while they would typically operate by
             different rules, by simply existing within an I&A-borne world, the machinations of
             their arcana alter to reflect the nature of the universe they have found themselves
             in.</p>
            <p>Given here is a list of spells that these Others might be capable of casting, at
             the GM's discretion (most Others would also likely be able to cast various
             Aetherian spells as well). Nearly all Sentients would absolutely <b>not</b> have
             the ability to cast these spells on their own, though Otherian enchanted items can
             provide a limited means of access to them.</p>
            
            <h2>Otherworldly Spells</h2>
            <p>It is worth noting that all Otherworldly spells require the caster to speak and
             gesticulate in order to command and direct the power of the spell; in the case of 
             Sentients using enchanted items, assume that the item itself transfers the knowledge
             of the words and movements necessary to the user at the time of attunement.</p>

            <h2>Optional Rule: Spell Misfires</h2>
            <p>As the GM, if you feel so inclined, you can implement spell misfires, which are 
             strange and random effects that occur when a casting goes wrong. When, how, and if
             you implement them is up to you, but here are a few suggestions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spells have a percent chance to misfire equal to 5 times their Mana Cost
                 (good for "corrupted" or otherwise compromised areas/enchanted items);</li>
                <li>Spells have a percent chance to misfire equal to their Mana Cost;</li>
                <li>Spells might misfire if their casting is interrupted;</li>
                <li>Spells might misfire if the <i>Counterspell</i> spell is used on them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If an effect says the caster or the target is affected, there is a 50% chance which it is.
             Additionally, if an effect says it applies to a target, it applies to all the chosen targets of
             the spell unless it would not make sense to do so. If the effect is a spell that requires a save,
             use the caster's Aether Save DR.</p>
