            <p>Classless feats serve as a way to give your character unique abilities or enhance their
             existing ones in some way. They can make characters stand out, and their uses range from the 
             martial to the social to the explorative. Given here is a list of feats that can be learned by 
             any character of any class.</p>
            <p>Though classless feats are typically learned at certain levels, a character can also learn
             one with a sufficient amount of training: specifically, it takes a character 90 cumulative day's
             rests of training to learn a given classless feat, assuming they are being trained by someone
             who already knows the feat.</p>
