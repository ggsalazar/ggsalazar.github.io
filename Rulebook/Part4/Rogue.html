            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Rogue you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d8 (or 4.5) + your CON score per Rogue level after 1st</p>
            <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain 1 proficiency in Thieving Tools, up to 5;</li>
                    <li>Select one Weapon Skill to gain proficiency in as you level up.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Precision Attack</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, you know how to take advantage of a creature’s weakness. Once per turn, if you
             have advantage on an attack that was made with a weapon that you have <u>></u>2 proficiency in 
             (not counting spells), you add a single damage die to the roll; you also gain this benefit on
             attacks against creatures that are engaged in melee combat with at least 1 other creature. The
             number of additional damage dice you roll increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown
             on the Rogue class table. You do not gain this benefit if you are wearing armor that grants 
             disadvantage on DEX checks (including Medium and Large shields).</p>
             
            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>Also at 1st level, you are extraordinarily skilled with some of your talents. Pick any
             two Action or Tool Skills that you have <u>></u> 2 proficiency in; your proficiency in 
             both of those skills increases by 1, and both of those skills can now be increased to 6,
             even if another feature says they can only be increased to 5.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, pick two more Action or Tool skills for this feature to apply to.</p>
            
            <h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>
            <p>Lastly at 1st level, you can speak and write Thieves’ Cant.</p>
            
            <h2>Quick Hands</h2>
            <p>At 2nd level, your roguish finesse allows you to perform most actions slightly quicker,
             reducing the time cost of all actions <i>except</i> the following by .5 seconds, to a minimum
             of 0 seconds: Attack, Grapple, Pin, Shove, or spellcasting.</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, you are skilled and learned enough that you start to specialize your
             talents. At the end of the class description, under “Class Feats”, you may select one 
             Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 9th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class
             feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 13th level, you may choose either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 17th level your skills are the stuff of legend, and you may
             now select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites 
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say 
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Feat and Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1 or two of them by .5, as well as take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Dodge</h2>
            <p>Starting at 5th level, your ability to anticipate and avoid incoming danger is 
             unsurpassed. From now on, when determining your Dodge, double your AGI 
             and DEX scores.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Reflexes</h2>
            <p>By the time you hit 7th level, your ability to save yourself from incoming harm is
             extraordinary, increasing your Reflex score by 1, up to 6; if your Reflex was already 6, then 
             the bonus to it becomes the sum of your AGI and DEX, rather than just the larger of the two.</p>
            
            <h2>Honed Skill</h2>
            <p>At 11th level, your skills are starting to become unmatched. From now on, whenever
             you make any sort of skill check, if one of the die you rolled come up as a 1, you can
             reroll one of them once. This feature stacks with other abilities that give similar benefits.</p>
            
            <h2>6th Sense</h2>
            <p>Starting at 14th level, you cannot be surprised, and so long as you can see and 
             hear, you automatically know the location of any being within 3m of you, so long as
             they are not hidden from you.</p>
            
            <h2>Slippery Mind</h2>
            <p>When you hit 15th level, your sharp mind grants you added protection against 
             mental intrusion, increasing your <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower score</a> by 1, up
             to 6; if your Willpower was already 6, then the bonus to it becomes the sum of your CHA and 
             chosen mental score, rather than just the larger of the two.</p>
            
            <h2>Elusive</h2>
            <p>At 18th level, you’re very difficult to hit. From now on, attacks against you that would have
             advantage become normal attacks unless they have advantage from more than one source.</p>
            
            <h2>Reliable Luck</h2>
            <p>Finally, at 20th level, your uncanny luck seems to always have you covered. Whenever you make
             any kind of save or attack, if you fail the save or deal no final damage, you can roll again and use either result.</p>
            
            <h1>Rogue Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Rogues are tricksters, clever combatants, and capable skill monkeys, and their 
             class feats enhance their tricks and wits and give them more options to obtain their 
             goals. Some focus on their skills, enhancing their ability to aid their groups outside
             of combat, while others enhance their combat prowess and Precision Attacks, making 
             themselves the most feared combatant on the battlefield.</p>
