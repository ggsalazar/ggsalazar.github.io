            <h2>Spicing it Up</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this chapter and the next, both of which being entirely optional,
             is to help you flesh out the life and backstory of your character. Within 
             this chapter are a miasma of tables full of details, tidbits, and extraneous life 
             events that can help make your character really stand out, both at the table and in 
             your mind. You can roll on each and every table to give your character an extremely 
             colorful life, or handpick one or two traits from just one or two tables, or anything 
             in-between.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that many of these tables ask almost as many 
             questions as they answer – a great many of the results leave a lot of details 
             intentionally vague and do not paint a complete picture on their own. Not only would it
             be arduous and incredibly difficult to create a result for every possible outcome to 
             every possible situation, but the point of these tables is to inspire and get you to 
             think about and help write your own story, not to do all of the work for you. This 
             chapter is meant to function more like a series of guidelines than a step-by-step 
             complete backstory.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can take each entry literally as it is written, or 
             take it as inspiration and make it your own, putting your own spin and twist on it and 
             using it as a launching point for a completely unique piece of your own story. Whatever 
             the case may be, be sure to have fun!</p>
            
            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>The following tables deal with the happenings of your early life, the 
             circumstances of your birth, your immediate family, and the like. It is recommended, 
             though not necessary, that you roll on the tables in order.</p>
