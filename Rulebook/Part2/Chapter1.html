            <h2>Forging Your Life Story</h2>
            <p>An adventurer’s background is an important part of their life prior to becoming an
             adventurer; it was their life until they decided to take up the sword and spend their days on the
             road. For character development, your character’s background should give you a starting point
             on their journey, their story, their arc; it is a springboard from which their tale launches at the
             start of their adventures.</p>
            <p>When coming up with your character’s background, consider what drove them from their
             past life to their current one, why they have taken up a life of adventure, what drives them to do
             the things they do; consider how the life they used to live affects how they react to the things
             they encounter in their travels. In short, think carefully about how it shaped them as a person. 
             Mechanically, your background will give you a small boost to your stats, extra proficiencies in a 
             handful of skills, and a single Classless Feat.</p>
            <p>Though the framework given is rather barren of flavorful details or narratively 
             enriching elements, this is intended to give you that much more freedom in creating your perfect 
             character without restriction. Ideally, your character can come from any walk of life, and the 
             bonuses you give them using this framework should reflect their life up to this point. If you 
             are having trouble coming up with your character’s life story, the following two chapters can 
             be used to help guide and inspire you into crafting a noteworthy and fleshed-out life for your character.</p>
