            <h2>Creating Equipment</h2>
            <p>Crafting is exactly what it sounds like: you are using tools that you own and have
             proficiency with to create gear and equipment from scratch (provided you also have the 
             necessary materials). Given here is a list of tools, and for each tool, a list of items
             that can be created and the resources (including time and money) needed to make each 
             item. <a href="../Part5/Chapter4.html">This chapter</a> contains a
             list of crafting resources and their costs. If an activity does not explicitly say how
             long it takes, assume it takes an entire day’s rest.</p>

                        <b>Alchemy.</b> The details of alchemy are covered 
                         <a href="../Part7/Chapter2.html">here</a>.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Gunpowder.</b> These tools can be used to create a pound of gunpowder, provided 
                         you also have 1 Aeon's worth of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter. This requires a 
                         successful DR 15 check with these tools; should you fail, you will take 2d6 burn 
                         final damage as the reagent violently explodes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Smoke Bombs.</b> Smoke bombs allow a creature to take the Hide action so long as
                         they are standing within the area covered by the smoke. The smoke from one of these 
                         bombs lasts for a minute or until a strong wind blows it away. The DR to create a 
                         smoke bomb of a given size is equal to 3 times a single dimension of space that the smoke 
                         would occupy, e.g. the DR to craft a smoke bomb that covers a 6x6x6 area is 18. 
                         These can also be crafted with Explosives Kits.

                    <br>
                        <b>Drawing.</b> To create a drawing, you need 1 sheet of parchment and drawing 
                         utensils, both of which are included with the supplies. 6d4 hours must be spent 
                         working on the drawing, though the amount of d4s that must be rolled is reduced by
                         an amount equal to your Art Supplies proficiency. The quality of the drawing is 
                         determined by the result of an Art Supplies check. The drawing is not worth very 
                         much on its own, but may come in handy in other ways.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Painting.</b> To create a painting, you need an easel, paints, and paint brushes,
                         all of which are included with the supplies. 10d10 hours must be spent working on 
                         the painting, though the amount of d10s that must be rolled is reduced by an amount
                         equal to your Art Supplies proficiency. The quality of the painting is determined 
                         by the result of an Art Supplies check; the exact worth of the painting in Aeons is
                         equal to half the result of your check.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sculpture.</b> To create a sculpture, you need sculpting tools – included with the
                         supplies – and enough clay to sculpt your project. It takes 1d12 hours to sculpt 
                         something from 30 cubic centimeters of clay, which costs 2 Aeons. Ergo, if you wished to 
                         create a 180cm tall sculpture of a Sentient, it would cost you 12 (2 times 6) 
                         Aeons in clay and 6d12 hours in time. The worth of your creation in Aeons is equal to twice
                         the result of your check.

                        <b>Armor.</b> To forge armor, you need a forge and enough materials to craft the
                         desired item. For simplicity, assume a single ingot of metal is enough to forge 
                         20 pounds of armor, and it takes a number of hours equal to double the weight of
                         the armor to forge it. The DR to craft armor is triple the Armor bonus the armor
                         gives you; ergo, the DR to forge Normal plate armor (Beast Hide and Steel)
                         would be 30; to forge Masterful plate armor (Dragon Scale and Monster 
                         Hide) would be 48. Failing the check will not expend your resources, and you can
                         try again as many times as you need.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Weapons.</b> To forge weapons, you need a forge and enough steel or adamantite to
                         craft the desired item (mithril is too heavy to use for weaponry). For simplicity,
                         assume a single ingot of metal is enough to forge 20 pounds of weaponry, and it takes a
                         number of hours equal to double the weight of the weapon to forge it. The DR to 
                         create Normal weapons is equal to double the maximum value of its base 
                         damage die, e.g. the DR to create a Normal dagger is 8, since its base 
                         damage die is a d4. For higher-quality weapons, the DR increases by the maximum value
                         of the base damage die for each level of quality above Normal, e.g. the DR to craft a 
                         Fine dagger is 12 (8+4), the DR for an Exquisite dagger is 16, and so
                         on. Repeaters and revolvers are the exception; for them, the Normal DR is triple the
                         maximum value of their base damage die. Normal and Fine weapons require steel, while
                         Exquisite and Masterful weapons require adamantite. Failing the check will
                         not expend your resources, and you can try again as many times as you need.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Mech Weapons.</b> To create a mech weapon, you can forge the individual parts using
                         the normal DRs, but must use tinkering tools to amalgamate them into one object; 
                         refer to <b>Mech Weapons</b> under Tinkering Tools below.

                         final weight of the finished item, and takes 6d6 days, though the number of d6s 
                         rolled to determine the time necessary is reduced by an amount equal to your 
                         Carpentry Tools proficiency. The DR to create a piece of furniture is equal to its
                         weight in pounds. The worth of your creation in Aeons is equal to ¼ the result of 
                         your check.

                         Creating a map of an area that you are familiar with requires 1d6 Aeons in research
                         to reaffirm your knowledge and 1 day doing the research and drawing the map; to 
                         create a map of an unfamiliar area, you need to spend 2d10 Aeons in research, 2

                    <br>
                        <b>Explosives.</b> Using a bit of gunpowder and a handful of hours, you can craft
                         grenades and other improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.<br>
                        Each meter of radius for your explosives requires ½ a pound of gunpowder
                         and 1d6 hours; so for example, if you wanted to create a grenade that 
                         affects a 6m diameter sphere, that would require 1½ pounds of gunpowder
                         and 3d6 hours. The fuse time – the time it takes for an explosive to
                         explode – for a standard grenade is a few seconds, but you can specify
                         a different fuse time for any explosives of your own creation. For a
                         fuse time of 3 seconds, assume the grenade explodes at the end of 
                         your turn; for 3.1-6 seconds, assume it explodes during your next turn;
                         for 6.1-9 seconds, assume it explodes during your second next turn, and
                         so on.<br>
                        <br>
                        The damage your explosive deals starts at 2d8 burn with ½ a pound of gunpowder, and
                         increases with additional ½-pounds: specifically, at 1 pound of gunpowder, your
                         explosive deals 3d8 burn damage, then 3d10 at 1½ pounds, then 4d10 at 2 pounds,
                         then 4d12 at 2½; each additional ½-pound then increases the damage by 1d12.<br>
                        <br>
                        Lastly, while crafting an explosive of any kind, you must succeed on a DR 10 DEX +

                         entire thing explode, in which case you and all other creatures in the would-be
                         area of effect take the damage the finished explosive would have dealt;

                        <b>Smoke bombs.</b> Smoke bombs allow a creature to take the Hide action so long as
                         they are standing within the area covered by the smoke. The smoke from one of these
                         bombs lasts for a minute or until a strong wind blows it away. The DR to create a 
                         smoke bomb of a given size is equal to 3 times a single dimension of space that the
                         smoke would occupy, e.g. the DR to craft a smoke bomb that covers a 6x6x6 area 
                         is 18. These can also be crafted with Alchemy Supplies.

                         requires 1d10 Aeons in research and 2 days to perform said research and forge the
                         documents themselves. The Insight DR to see through your forgeries is equal to the

                         result, granted you have enough gunpowder; it takes ½ an ounce of gunpowder to make
                         1 bullet (there are 16 ounces in a pound).
                         During a day's rest, you make an amount of bullets equal to twice the

                         and during a night's rest, you make a number of those equal to 1/10th the result
                         of your check, disregarding the remainder; during a day's rest, you make a
                         number of LRR bullets equal to 1/4 the result of your check, again disregarding
                         the remainder.
