            <h2>Ideas and Inspirations</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, especially for new GMs, it can be difficult to come up with ideas for
             campaigns, be it for an entire arc or just a simple side quest. For this reason, a
             handful of ideas for different campaigns and quests at various tiers are supplied here;
             these can be the source of anything from a short quest to a full-blown campaign. The 
             only limit is your imagination!</p>
            
            <h2>Any Tier</h2>
            <p>The hooks given here are designed to be vague and open-ended, so that a GM can 
             easily modify them appropriately and slide them into their campaign regardless of their
             party’s collective level.</p>

                         and either has started causing trouble or will soon. Perhaps the PCs arrive at a

                         silhouette of an Elder God against the sky the day after a meteor crashes into the

                        A powerful government official has taken to slandering the party and condemning 
                         all that they have done, reframing all of their deeds in a negative light and 
                         painting them as threats and terrors to the people. The party must find a way to 
                         clear their names and silence the noble, who is too well protected and too powerful
                         for a direct assault or assassination attempt.

                        Recent years have seen the rise of a disturbing trend: Sentients being born with a 
                         condition that can only be described as Soulless – quite literally, they are being 
                         born without souls. The PCs must travel to the Plane of Soul, confront the Unliving,
                         and see what the problem is and how it can be solved.

            <p>Finally, the PCs are beginning to approach the absolute apex of their abilities.
             Their names are well-known, the world regards them as heroes – or villains – and their
             tales will likely be recorded in the history books and told around campfires for
             generations to come. They may even be unmatched in their abilities, and for this reason
             are entrusted with resolving only the greatest of threats – threats to the entire world
             or the planes themselves. Refer to the hooks below for inspiration if you feel so 
             inclined.</p>

                        One of the Titans has, for some reason, become absolutely enraged at the Sentients,
                         either as a whole or a specific group of them, and threatens to wipe them out. 
                         Resolving this will take everything the PCs have.
