            <h2>Going Mad</h2>
            <p>Adventuring can be a… traumatizing profession. Adventurers are often under assault
             by horrifying monsters, see their friends, loved ones, and compatriots die to the claws
             of some bloodthirsty beast, or have their minds directly assaulted by eldritch and 
             arcane forces specifically engineered to damage a Sentient mind. All this to say, there
             are times when a character undergoes an event so traumatizing it leaves a lasting mark 
             on their psyche, sometimes just for a few hours, and sometimes for the rest of their 
             lives. Given here is a list of madnesses that a character may suffer from after 
             experiencing a traumatic event, including but by no means limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>failing certain <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower saves</a> (the effect will
                 usually say if the character gains some form of madness and for how long);</li>
                <li>losing more than half of their Health in a single blow;</li>
                <li>close brushes with death, such as being knocked <a href="./Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> or dying and being 
                 resurrected/resuscitated;</li>
                <li>seeing their loved ones die;</li>
                <li>going without sleep for extended periods of time;</li>
                <li>being tortured for an extended period of time, such as a day or more;</li>
                <li>witnessing something particularly horrifying.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A character can experience madness for any number of hours, days, 
             months, or years; the exact length of time will either be specified by the maddening
             effect or is up to the GM. Additionally, a madness may go away – or at the very least, 
             become less severe – with the passage of time and/or proper psychological treatment
             (unless the cause of the madness was arcane in nature). Lastly, when deciding what form
             of madness a character gains, the GM may use the following table or come up with their
             own.</p>

            <h2>Roleplaying Madness</h2>
            <p>Madness and insanity can be a great way to put an interesting spin on your 
             character; however, the nature of the madnesses themselves make them a detriment, and it
             would almost certainly be in your character’s best interest to be cured of them as soon
             as possible. If your madness(es) start(s) to detract from your and/or the party’s fun, 
             or if you suspect that will soon be the case, then it may be for the best to retire the
             afflicted character, either permanently or until a cure for their illness is found. In 
             the meantime, you can try out a different character, or if you are forced to part from 
             your group for a period of time, this may provide a prime reason within the narrative 
             for your character to take a similar leave of absence.</p>
