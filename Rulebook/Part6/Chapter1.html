            <p>Characters are able to perform a variety of actions as they explore and interact with the 
             world during their adventures. These actions can be performed in or out of combat, and many
             can be performed as reactions.</p>
            <p>During each round of combat, a creature has 3 seconds to act, with each possible action
             having its own Time Cost, though a creature's <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">DEX score</a> 
             can reduce the amount of time actions take, to a minimum of .5 seconds for any non-trivial action. Most creatures
             also have 1 reaction at their disposal that they can use during any other creature’s turn; 
             while reactions do not necessarily have a Time Cost, for flavor reasons they can be considered
             to take about 1 second. Certain class features, spells, enchanted items, or other special
             circumstances may grant a creature more actions or reactions.</p>
             
            <h2>Holding Actions</h2>
            <p>If a creature so desires, instead of spending all 3 of the seconds at their disposal on their
             turn, they can instead hold up to 3 seconds' worth of actions while they wait for a specific
             trigger, which they must state at the time they decide to hold these actions; if this trigger
             occurs, they then use their reaction to perform their held actions, and if it doesn't, they
             lose those actions, but can use their reaction for something else if they desire.</p>

                        When a creature takes this action, they are choosing to attack a creature or object
                         within the range of their currently equipped weaponry, their spells, or whatever
                         else they may wish to use. If you do not have enough time at your disposal to make
                         an attack with this weapon, you can use the rest of your remaining time to attack
                         with it once with disadvantage, or you can start the attack on your current turn 
                         and finish it on your next turn. Lastly, regardless of how high a creature's DEX
                         score is, the least amount of time this action can take is .5 seconds. <br>

                        To blind a creature, the blinder must make a DEX check contested against the
                         target’s Reflex save. On a success, the target is 
                         <a href="./Chapter3.html">blinded</a> until they use 3 seconds to remove the
                         blinding element from their eyes.

                        Whatever weapons a character has in their equipment slots at any given point are
                         their equipped weapons, and they can attack with only those weapons unless they

                        To disarm a creature, the disarmer must make a Sleight of Hand
                         or STR check contested by the DEX or STR check of the creature they are attempting
                         to disarm. On a success, the weapon is plucked out of their hand and thrown 1d3 
                         meters away in a direction of the disarmer’s choosing. The weapon can be caught by
                         you or another person in the weapon’s path with a successful DR 15 Sleight of Hand
                         check, provided the being attempting to catch it has an empty hand and their reaction.

                        A creature disengages when they wish to leave the melee range
                         of all opponents they are currently in melee range of without provoking any 
                         opportunity attacks. If they enter a new opponent’s melee range, they must

                        Evading is a being’s way of preparing for an incoming attack or harmful effect and 
                         bracing themselves against it. When a creature evades, their Dodge score is doubled
                         and they have advantage on Reflex saves until the start of their next turn. Doing
                         this consumes the rest of your available time on your turn, assuming you have 1.5 seconds remaining.

                        <br>
                        When choosing to grapple another creature, the grappler must make a STR or DEX check
                         contested against the Reflex save of the target. On a success, the target is
                         <a href="./Chapter3.html">grappled</a> by the grappler, and may use 3 seconds on 
                         their turn to make a STR or DEX check to free themselves contested against the 
                         grappler’s STR or DEX check. Alternatively, you can choose to restrain the target
                         using a tool, such as manacles or a rope, though you cannot take other actions
                         while restraining them.

                        <br>
                        The Hide action is used when a creature wishes to avoid being spotted by another 
                         entity. In order to hide, a creature needs something to hide behind/in and must make
                         a Stealth check contested by the searching party’s Perception check.

                        Your maximum jump height in meters is equivalent to half your STR score,

                         with a running start, it becomes twice your STR score. A running start requires a 
                         character to run uninterrupted for at least 3m in a straight line
                         before the jump.

                        This is arguably the most loosely-definable action, since it can apply to almost 
                         infinitely different situations. This action is used when a creature wishes to 
                         interact with their environment in such a way that is not otherwise described here;
                         examples include propping a chair up against a door, flipping a table over to use
                         it as cover, or smashing through a glass pane. It is up to the GM whether the 
                         action a creature wishes to improvise is doable and, if it is, how difficult it is
                         and how much time it takes to do.

                         exception. For example, if a character with 3 seconds left on their turn and a speed
                         of 3m/sec used all 3 seconds to move through difficult terrain, they could only

                        <br>
                        Using almost any weapon and/or appropriate item, a creature can pin another to a
                         surface, usually by impaling their clothes to that surface or weighing them down
                         with something heavy. When a creature takes this action, they must make a STR/DEX 
                         check contested against the target’s Fort./Ref. save (determined by what check the
                         pinner is making): if the pinner wins the contest, the target is considered 
                         <a href="./Chapter3.html">grappled</a> by whatever is pinning them, and can take 3
                         seconds on their next turn to make a STR/DEX check to free themselves. The DR for
                         this check is the result of the pinner’s original STR/DEX check.<br>
                        <br>
                        The time cost to do this varies depending on what is being used: if
                         using a weapon, the time cost is the same as the weapon, and if using
                         an item found in the immediate environment, the time cost is 3 seconds.

                        To shove a creature, make a STR check contested against their attempted
                         victim’s Fort./Ref. save;
                         on a success, they are shoved a number of meters equal to twice the
                         shover’s STR score (minimum 1) in a direction of their choice.

                        To tackle a creature, one must first have moved in a straight line towards

                         quaffing a potion (3.5 seconds) or opening a container (2 seconds). If the item
                         is large and/or would take a large amount of time and/or effort to use, then it may
                         require more than a few seconds to perform.

             has at least 1 reaction at their disposal each round, which can be used on any turn other than 
             their own. As stated above, there are some features that add to
             a character’s list of possible reactions, but those are not described here.</p>

                         performs an activity that distracts them from their opponent, such as administering
                         a potion to another creature or casting a spell that requires more actions than the
                         caster has left on their turn. The Disengage action can be used to avoid attacks of 
                         opportunity, and forced movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
