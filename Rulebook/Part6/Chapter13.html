            <center><h1>Chapter 13: Traps</h1></center>
            <p>Bane to and slayer of many an adventurer, traps can be found almost anywhere, but
             are most commonly found in diabolically designed dungeons, from clever and conniving 
             bandit lairs to the tombs of greedy and paranoid long-dead rulers. Just as varied as 
             the location of traps is the nature of them; they can be a complicated mess of shooting
             arrows and swinging blades, or as simple as a 3m deep pit covered in leaves and 
             thin planks.</p>
            <p>Three types of traps exist in I&A, and two (simple and complex) are
             described in detail in this chapter. Simple traps are defined by 
             having at least 1 of 2 characteristics: they are either mechanically simple and can be 
             constructed relatively easily with materials on-hand, and/or they perform only one 
             action after being triggered, and must then be reset (either automatically or manually)
             before they can do anything else. Complex traps can perform multiple actions 
             autonomously before they shut down and/or need to be reset.</p>
            <p>The third type of traps, which is not covered here, is arcane traps, which are 
             typically spells that have been set as a trap or a power of an enchanted item.</p>
            
            <h2>Detecting Traps</h2>
            <p>Most every trap has a visible or otherwise detectable component of some sort – a 
             pressure plate that sticks out, a tripwire that stands apart from the environment, 
             loose and creaking timbers ready to give way at any moment, etc. If the visible component
             of a trap is exceedingly obvious, it can be assumed any nearby creatures see it 
             immediately without the need for a check – though it is worth noting that just because
             a component of a trap is visible doesn’t mean its triggering mechanism is as well, 
             though it may make spotting the trigger easier.</p>
            <p>If a trap’s trigger is not obviously detectable and the players state
             that their characters are looking for traps or other dangers, the GM can have them make
             Perception checks to look for them (arcane traps may also be detected with a successful
             Arcana check). Once a trap or one of its components is spotted, a character can make a
             Mechanics/Arcana check to discern how the trap works, its damage, where the trigger is,
             etc. The amount and nature of information gained is determined by how well the check
             succeeded and the GM’s discretion.</p>
            
            <h2>Disabling Traps</h2>
            <p>Once a trap and/or its trigger has been spotted, it can usually be safely 
             circumvented by simply avoiding it. Much of the time, however, the safer option – if for
             no other reason than peace of mind – may be to disable the trap, either by damaging 
             it/its trigger and making it utterly useless, or by (temporarily) jamming the 
             mechanisms of the trap so that it no longer works, but could likely be repaired with
             some effort. Thieving Tools will almost always accomplish the desired effect, but they
             are not explicitly necessary most of the time, e.g. a normal dagger can cut a tripwire 
             just fine (usually), or rocks can be stuffed into arrow slits to block them.
             The PCs may even be able to trigger a trap from a safe distance, expending it or giving
             themselves time until the trap resets to bypass it (this method is especially effective
             with arcane traps).</p>
            <p>If a character attempting to disarm a trap does not get a 
             <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">partial success</a>, the trap triggers.</p>
            
            <h2>Triggering Traps</h2>
            <p>Each and every trap has a trigger, a specific mechanism that will release the 
             trap’s effects onto anyone and anything in the area of effect. Three sample 
             triggers, the Pressure Plate, the Tripwire, and the Opening Door are given here;
             the DRs given assume the trigger is uncovered and unmodified in any way. Special
             triggers, along with their respective DRs, will be given with their appropriate 
             traps.<br>
            <b>Pressure Plate.</b> Spot DR 12, disable DR 10 (STR/DEX).<br>
            <b>Tripwire.</b> Spot DR 16, no disable DR.<br>
            <b>Opening Door.</b> Spot DR 16, disable DR 18 (DEX/Thieving Tools).</p>
            
            <h2>Avoiding Traps</h2>
            <p>When a trap is triggered, each creature in the affected area must make a Reflex save to avoid
             the trap's effects. On a full success, the saving creature completely avoids the effects of 
             the trap and they are moved to the nearest space that is outside of the trap's area of effect.
             On a Partial Success, the saving creature takes half damage from the trap (if the trap deals 
             damage over time, this applies only to the first round that the trap deals damage) and has 
             advantage on the first save against the trap's effects if one is required. On a failure, the
             saving creature takes the full effects of the trap. Trap damage is always reduced by a 
             creature's RaDEF.</p>
             
            <h2>Trap Effects</h2>
            <p>Many traps have many different effects. Though most traps do deal damage and many
             are meant to kill, this is not always the case; many are designed to just hinder, maim,
             or inconvenience, or a series of traps may be designed to whittle away at a group’s 
             resources. When designing traps for your adventures and dungeons, consider both the 
             specific effects of the trap – does it deal damage, restrain a person(s), is it a puzzle
             unto itself, etc. – and the overall purpose of the trap – is it designed to whittle 
             away at intruders, buy time for an enemy to escape, protect a priceless artifact, or 
             something else entirely? Be creative and have fun with it, but try to ensure that your
             traps have a purpose and are not simply a hazard for hazard’s sake.</p>
            
            <h2>Sample Traps</h2>
            <p>Given here are a smattering of example traps designed to be easily understandable,
             modifiable, and inspirational, and to give an idea of how to design your own traps. All
             the traps given are mechanical in nature, and each trap will specify if it is simple or
             complex. The trap’s sample trigger(s) (including spot and disable DRs), area of effect,
             effects, and Mechanics DR will all be specified, as well as a couple of possible 
             modifications for different versions of the trap. Every trap described will be assumed
             to be in its most simple, plain, unmodified, and obvious form.</p>

                        <br>
                        <b>Effects.</b> The purpose of an alarm is usually to alert the setter of the trap 
                         to any intruders without directly harming the intruders, almost always through loud
                         and disruptive noise that starts immediately upon the trap being triggered. The 
                         source of the noise can be bells, falling objects, a machine specifically designed
                         as an alarm, or any other such implement.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Mechanics DR.</b> Pressure plate: 15 – Tripwire: 6.<br>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Modifications</h4>
                        <b>Deafening Alarm.</b>With this variation, the source of the noise is extremely loud
                         and sudden, and deliberately placed next to the trap trigger. When this version of 
                         the trap is triggered, any creatures within 2 meters of the source of the noise 
                         (usually directly adjacent to the trigger) take 1d6 sonic final damage and must 
                         succeed on a DR 15 <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude save</a>
                         or be <a href="./Chapter3.html">deafened</a> for 1 minute. The 
                         Mechanics DR for this version of the trap is 20 (pressure plate)/10 (tripwire), and
                         any creature that knows how it works has advantage on their save.

                        <b>Effects.</b> When this trap is triggered, the area of effect immediately ignites 
                         and starts burning until the blaze’s fuel runs out, dealing 2d8 burn damage whenever
                         a creature enters its area of effect and at the start of each affected creature’s 
                         turns.<br>

                        <b>Electrified Surface.</b> In this version of the trap, the area of effect becomes 
                         electrified instead of lighting on fire. The Mechanics DR for this version of the 
                         trap is 25 (pressure plate)/22 (tripwire).<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Frictionless Surface.</b> This version of the trap may or may not trigger at all;
                         the surface itself may simply be frictionless by nature, or if there is a trigger,
                         some sort of liquid or other slickening agent may, for all intents and purposes, 
                         make the surface frictionless. There is no Spot DR for the trigger-less version of
                         this trap, but the surface itself has a Mechanics DR of 10; for the triggered 
                         version, the Spot DRs are the same, and the Mechanics DRs become 15 (pressure plate)/10

                         area of effect, dealing an appropriate amount of physical damage. The amount of 
                         damage this trap deals may vary greatly depending on the materials that are caving
                         in (natural stone, rotting wood, etc.) and the amount of them (tons of rock and 
                         stone, a few timbers, etc.)<br>

                        <b>Collapsing Building.</b> If a cave-in would cause more than 1 floor to collapse on
                         a creature, then for every extra floor, increase the damage the trap deals by a 
                         factor of 1. For example, if a normal wooden roof cave-in would cause 2d6 damage to
                         its victims, then a 2-story wooden cave-in should deal 4d6, 3 stories would be 6d6,
                         etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Seal-in.</b> This version of this trap is not designed to deal damage, though it 
                         still can. Instead, a seal-in trap is designed to cause a cave-in around 1 or more 
                         of the immediate area’s entrances/exits.

                         them, the closing can be delayed until the pressure destroys the item (or the walls,
                         depending on their strength). If any creatures in the area of effect do not manage 
                         to leave the area before the walls start to press on them, their movement will be
                         halved and they will take 4d12 physical damage (reduced only by their Armor score)
                         at the start of each of their turns. If a character being crushed is reduced to 0 
                         Health, they are crushed and killed instantly.<br>

                         the spikes mechanically and methodically repeat their thrusting motion in and out of
                         the area of effect. This alteration raises the Mechanics DRs for the trap to 15 
                         (pressure plate)/18 (tripwire), and makes the spikes deal their damage each time
                         the emerge; so if the spikes emerge every 2 seconds, an affected creature takes damage
                         from them every 2 seconds.<br>

                         difference being that the bottom of the pit has something in it, be it spikes, lava,
                         a swarm of insects, or anything else that adds danger to the pit. If the danger is
                         not liquid, the falling creature takes falling damage as normal + whatever damage 
                         the added danger deals. If it is liquid, the falling creature takes half falling
