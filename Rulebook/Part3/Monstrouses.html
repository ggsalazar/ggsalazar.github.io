            <div class="content">
                <h2>Drakon Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Drakon are covered head-to-toe in scales and have sharp teeth,
                 claws, and prehensile tails. Horns of various lengths and styles decorate their heads,
                 upper backs, and joints. Male Drakon typically have larger and more pronounced horns 
                 than females. Their eye colors are usually green, red, yellow, or blue.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Drakon usually live to be about 80. They reach
                 maturity at around 15.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Drakon vary from about 180 - 210cm tall and
                 are stocky in build, usually around 200 – 300 pounds. They are Big creatures.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak and write
                 Common and Drake.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Drakon have a Dodge Penalty of -4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Being Big, your RaDEF is your DEF + 2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Drakon's base Speed is 3.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Since you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and
                 lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Drakon are dragon-like, and the following are several Heritage features that
                 fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage feature list.<br>
                <b>Breath Weapon.</b> Select one damage type that is not fatigue, physical, or true; once
                 between night's rests, you can take 3 seconds (independent of your DEX) to expel a damaging burst of energy of that
                 damage type out of your mouth. This burst can take the form of either a 5-meter cone or a
                 10-meter line, deals 1d8 + your CON score base damage, and scales with your chosen Weapons
                 Proficiency.<br>
                <b>Claws and Fangs.</b> Drakon have sharp claws, which count as Unarmed weapons 
                 and deal 1d4 physical base damage.<br>
                <b>Scales.</b> Drakon are covered in scales that increases their base Armor score
                 to 2.<br>
                <b>Tail.</b> You have a prehensile tail, which is flexible, long, and strong
                 enough to essentially function as a 3rd arm.<br>
                <b>Wings.</b> You have a pair of leathery wings that grant you a flying speed; 
                 this flying speed is determined by your Size and STR score in the same manner 
                 your walking speed is determined by your Size and AGI score.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Goblins</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Goblin Traits</h2>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Goblins are generally thin and lanky creatures, with black or
                 dark grey hair and similar eyes. Their limbs have the appearance of being just a bit too
                 long for their lean torsos, and their skin varies between shades of dull grey, green, 
                 red, yellow, and blue, with the individual Goblins of one tribe or clan generally being
                 varying shades of one hue.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Goblins live short lives, maturing at 10 years old
                 and living to around 70.<br>
                <b><a href="../Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Goblin height varies by about a foot, from
                 as short as 120cm to as tall as 150cm, and they weigh anywhere between 60 to 140 pounds.
                 They can be Small (120-130cm) or Medium (131-150cm).<br>
                <b><a href="../Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You speak Common and Monstrine.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> A Goblin’s base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Goblins are small and lanky, making them hard to hit; if you are
                Small, your Dodge Penalty is -2 and if you are Medium, your Dodge Penalty is -3.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> If you are Small/Medium, your RaDEF is your DEF + 3/2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Being Small/Medium makes your base Speed 2.5/3m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Goblins are slippery little creatures, and the following are several Heritage
                 features that fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage
                 feature list.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Improve your DEX or AGI by .5, up to 5.
                 You can take this feature twice.<br>
                <b>Adaptability.</b> Your people have adapted to survive in a given environment,
                 granting you resistance to one damage type that is not fatigue, physical, or 
                 true. If you select poison, you do not gain resistance but instead gain advantage on saves 
                 against poisons and diseases.<br>
                <b>Animal Reflexes.</b> Your animalistic instinct for danger improves your Reflex
                 score by 1.<br>
                <b>Claws and Fangs.</b> Your Unarmed attacks deal 1d4 physical base damage.<br>

                <b>Appearance.</b> Kobolds are covered head-to-toe in scales of any one or two colors,
                 usually the same as the environment their clan has survived in for several
                 generations. Kobolds also have horns on their heads or spines running down their 
                 backs, though the lengths and styles of these vary from clan to clan and Kobold to 
                 Kobold. Their eye color is extremely varied. Female Kobolds have no perceptible 
                 breast tissue, longer snouts than males, and shorter horns/spines.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Kobolds live to around 60 and mature by the time they
