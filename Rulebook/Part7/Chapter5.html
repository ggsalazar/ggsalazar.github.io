            <center><h1>Chapter 5: The Planes</h1></center>
            <p>The rules of I&A, though designed to be setting-agnostic (i.e. not set in any particular
             world/setting), do assume that the world the game takes place in has a plane for each
             element, as well one that Sentient life occupies (e.g. a "normal" or "physical" plane).
             When creating a world using this ruleset, consider whether you want to have a cosmology 
             similar to this or if you want to create something entirely new. Either method is just as 
             acceptable, and you may use or borrow as many of the details presented here as you wish
             for your creation(s). The world of Aethra will be used as an example throughout this chapter.</p>
            <p>Aside from the planes themselves, it is very important to note how much of the cosmology
             the population of your world knows about, and when and how they learned it; as an 
             example, most educated persons on Aethra know of all of the planes presented below 
             except for the Unknown Plane, but they do not know many details, such as exactly how 
             large they are or what their occupants are like (though most everyone knows the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a> are hate-filled beings who will slaughter a
             Sentient as soon as they see them). Those who pursue higher education know some more than the 
             general populous, of course, but there are very few, if any, of those for whom any of the planes
             hold no secrets; no one knows what lies at the edges of the Plane of Air, for instance, or how
             the Unliving create new souls, or why the Fae play the games that they do. Additionally, very 
             few know of the existence of the Unknown Plane (though some have theorized about its existence),
             and any who speak about it or have had an encounter with something from it will usually either
             go insane or be written off as such.</p>
            
            <h2>The Planes</h2>
            <p>These rules describe 8 different planes: The Central Plane, the Unknown Plane, and the Elemental
             Planes.</p>
            <p><b>The Central Plane.</b> The home of all Sentients and Sentient civilizations, the Central Plane can be thought of as 
             the “natural” world. Generally, anything that doesn’t belong to or originate from here is 
             referred to as “extranatural”.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Dark.</b> The Dark Plane is, as the name would imply, quite dark in nature, as
             well as quite cold. So dark and cold, in fact, that it eats at any light inside it: while on 
             this plane, light sources, even arcane ones, are only half as strong, and fires are twice as 
             difficult to create and only last half as long. It is filled with howling winds, perpetually 
             falling snow and sleet, and chunks of permafrost that could easily be mistaken for whole
             landmasses. It is on this plane that the <a href="../../Bestiary/Hollow.html">Hollow</a> roam, 
             creating the darkness that makes its way throughout the universe, while the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Frozen.html">Frozen</a> stalk the lands hunting whatever they can find:
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Hollow.html">Hollow</a>, each other, and especially outsiders. Due to
             the forces of Decay, non-Sentient organic tissue will age and whither away at twice the natural
             rate; similarly, because of Twilight, sourceless light pervades this plane, pocketing it and
             gently illuminating it in various places.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Light.</b> Bright, pure white light pervades this plane, where
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Radiant.html">Radiant</a> live, creating, protecting, and 
             self-righteously "serving" the light that pervades the universe. Because of its nature, light 
             sources on this plane – including arcane ones – are twice as strong, though they are rarely
             needed. Additionally, in the more fiery places of this plane - such as the Magma Seas and the
             Burning Lands - hate-filled <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a> rove, looking
             for victims to rip and tear asunder. Because of the power of Twilight, shadows are present
             across the Light Plane, pocketing it and darkening it in various places; secondly, Lightning is
             present on this plane as well, striking it and streaking across it at occasional intervals.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Magic.</b> This is where the mischievous 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> play and dance with each other, and dream up new ways
             of screwing with Sentients and interfering in their lives, for better or worse. Like the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> themselves, the land here is covered in strange 
             vegetation and paradoxical structures that have both been permanently warped by the
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae's</a> mysticism. Should a 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> encounter a Sentient, they are unlikely to kill them;
             after all, how can you meddle with something that is dead? Instead, they are much more likely to
             capture and enslave it for their entertainment, until they grow bored of it, which may be 
             anywhere from a few days to the end of the Sentient’s natural life. In addition to the mystical
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> are the <a href="../../Bestiary/Vi.html">Vi</a>,
             animalistic yet highly intelligent creatures that can bend the power of Force to their strange 
             wills. Though the <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> and 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Vi.html">Vi</a> share an element, they are neither friends nor
             enemies, as their motives and modes of thinking are too different to make them allies, but their
             esoteric ways make them similar, in a sense. Due to the force of Prophecy, various powerful
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> are able to predict the future with some degree of 
             accuracy, while visiting Sentients may have prophetic dreams or predict something that is just
             about to occur. Conversely, due to the Lightning pseudo-element, streaks and sparks of lightning
             are not uncommon occurrences on the Magic Plane.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Soul.</b> Divided between the Living Oceans and the Dead Lands, this is the
             pocket of the universe where the souls of Sentients are both created and destroyed. In the 
             tossing and turning waters of the Living Oceans, the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Unliving</a> churn out new souls, with the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Didon</a> implanting them at the time of a Sentient's 
             birth or Awakening, and a <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Reaper</a> escorting it back 
             when a Sentient dies, leaving it in a place of its choosing in the Dead Lands - that is, unless
             the soul is tied to a specific object or place for one reason another. In the Dead Lands,
             Specters roam freely as they wait for what they call their “Second Death”, a process by which 
             their souls are destroyed and their existence ceases entirely. This Second Death occurs whenever
             the soul sustains too much damage to sustain itself, typically at the hands of one of the many 
             hostile <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a> that populate this plane and feast on
             souls for both sustenance and enjoyment. Alternatively, due to the power of Decay, a soul will
             whither away over time and become unable to sustain itself after about 100 years, though
             consuming other <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a> will delay this process. In many
             ways, being dead is much like being alive, and many souls view it as a second life in and of 
             itself. Also because of Decay, all living beings age twice as quickly in the Dead Lands, while
             they don't age at all (or may even grow younger) while in the Living Oceans. Since Death is
             adjacent to Frost, the Dead Lands are rather cold and it is not uncommon for it to lightly snow.</p>
             <p><b>The Plane of Space.</b> The home of the <a href="../../Bestiary/Ascended.html">Ascended</a>
             and the <a href="../../Bestiary/Buried.html">Buried</a>. Even more so than the others, this
             plane is divided into two: the floating, elevated lands of the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Ascended.html">Ascended</a> (sometimes called the Sub-Plane of Air) and
             the rocky, mountainous grounds and tunnels of the <a href="../../Bestiary/Buried.html">Buried</a>,
             referred to on occasion as the Sub-Plane of Earth. Because Air is adjacent to Past, the Memory 
             pseudo-element allows those on this plane to recall their past with perfect clarity; 
             alternatively, due to Earth's adjacency to Life, pools of water ranging from less than a meter
             to several hundred in width do pocket the Sub-Plane of Earth.</p>
            <p><b>The Plane of Time.</b> Split between the <a href="../../Bestiary/Futori.html">Futori</a>,
             who weave the strands of infinite possible futures into their varying courses, and the
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Praeteri.html">Praeteri</a>, who maintain those strands and preserve
             them for the annals of eternity. A rather unique place, the Plane of Time exists outside of time 
             itself, making it difficult for outsiders to discern just how long they have really been there.
             It is not unusual for travelers of the Time Plane to navigate its strange landscapes for what
             feels to be years, only to return to their home plane to find not a minute has passed; other
             times, they may be there for only a brief visit, perhaps a day at most, but return home to find 
             a year or more has passed. Due to the force of Memory, those on the Plane of Time can recall their
             own past with perfect accuracy, and due to the power of Prophecy, prophetic dreams and minor acts
             of precognition are common.</p>
             
            <h2>The Unknown Plane</h2>
            <p>Beyond the furthest reaches of any and all of the planes, there exists 
             something… else. Something alien, eldritch, and unknown, a sort of cosmic soup, older 
             than the elements themselves, from which Creation emerged. No one and nothing knows what lies beyond
             this realm, or where it comes from; on Aethra, the only being to ever traverse it was Ex
             Machina, and it has yet to return from that cosmic abyss. Occasionally, very rarely,
             something… Other, something utterly and entirely alien, will emerge from the Unknown 
             Plane, with unknowable objectives in mind. These beings do not operate by the same
             rules as Iron & Aether, and do not think the same way Sentients, Elementals, or any other known beings do. Their 
             goals, methods, and motives are inherently foreign and unknown, and as such it is
             impossible to truly trust anything that comes from this unknowable dimension.</p>
            <!--<p>The Bestiary has several examples of different <a href="../../Bestiary/Others.html">Others</a>,
             as well as descriptions of their abilities and possible motivations, to serve as 
             possible inspiration for any adventures or quests a GM may wish to run that has eldritch
             and/or cosmic elements. There is also the possibility of Other relics, ruins, or 
             dungeons if a GM would like to throw something new and unknown at their players.</p>-->
