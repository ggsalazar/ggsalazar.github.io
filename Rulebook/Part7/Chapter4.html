            <center><h1>Chapter 4: Relics</h1></center>
            
            <p>Relics are enchanted items that are so incredibly, wondrously powerful, and the 
             process to create them so complex and beyond Sentient understanding, that their kind 
             cannot be replicated, which may
             be for the best, as many of them hold incredible destructive potential within them. So 
             great is their power that simply by attuning to them – which, strangely enough, can
             happen near-instantly – the user will be both blessed with some sort of boon and
             cursed in some way.</p>
            <p>You can attune to only one relic at a time and cannot unattune from it
             without destroying the relic. The features, including boons and curses, bestowed by a 
             relic you have attuned to last until the relic is destroyed or you die; some relic 
             benefits require the relic to be on your person, and a relic’s description will say if
             this is the case. If you die and are resurrected within 24 hours, such as through a 
             Phylactery, the relic is still attuned to you; however, if you die and are not
             resurrected within that time, the relic is no longer attuned to you. During this 24 
             hours another person cannot attune to the relic. Lastly, if you ever lose or misplace 
             the relic, it reappears in your possession next midnight.</p>
            <p>Given here is a list of relics, along with the boons and curses gained 
             from attuning to them, and some lore to give them some backstory and an idea of their power,
             though the information given is vague enough to allow the GM to modify it at their 
             leisure. Any and all of the information pertaining to a relic, from their very existence
             to their powers, may be known or unknown to the characters, or even to the common 
             populace, depending on the nature and history of your GM’s world and their discretion. 
             You may learn this knowledge through research, from an ally, or through attuning to the
             relic itself.</p>
            <p>In addition to its normal properties, which are gained when the user attunes to
             the relic, each relic can also be awakened, which occurs after the user has 
             unlocked the relic’s true inner potential. The requirements to do this vary from 
             relic to relic, and a relic’s description will say what it needs in order to awaken.</p>
            <p>Lastly, destroying a relic is, as one might imagine, not easy. Each relic has its
             own special requirements to be destroyed, detailed in the relic’s description;
             otherwise, the relic is immune to damage.</p>
             
            <h2>Relic Boons</h2>
            <p>Given here is a list of boons, both major and minor, that a relic may bestow when
             the user attunes to it. The boons should be decided by the GM; when deciding what boons
             the attuning character receives, you may pick and choose or roll appropriately. If a boon
             has a * at the end of it, it cannot be granted more than once.</p>

            <div class="content">
            <br>
                <p><b>Lore.</b> Throughout the pages of history this mythical sword has gone by many 
                 names: Excalibur, Masamune, Tyrfing, Andúril. Throughout all of the legends, one 
                 commonality arises: a blade of great and unmatched power, that makes kings and 
                 legends of its wielders. It is said that, throughout its life, Excalibur has slain 
                 millions, be it through warfare, single combat, public execution, or any other 
                 method. Today, no Sentient can possibly know where history ends and legends begin, 
                 but any who wield this mythical blade quickly find that with a weapon like this at 
                 your side, such feats are not outside the realm of possibility.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> Excalibur bestows the following boons and
                 curses: 2 Minor Boons, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curse, and 1 Major Curse. Upon 
                 awakening, it bestows 1 more Major Boon and 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> When attuned to Excalibur, the user’s STR or DEX
                 (their choice) score immediately increases by .5, to a maximum of 6. Additionally, 
                 while Excalibur is always described as a sword, the user can use 2 actions to 
                 transform it into any Small, Medium, or Large weapon. Whatever form the weapon 
                 takes, and regardless of the user’s proficiency with the appropriate skill, attacks
                 with it are made at 5 proficiency and have a +5 bonus. At the start of combat, the
                 user also gains a +1d6 bonus to their initiative roll. Additionally, the mythical
                 blade grants a +3 bonus to the user’s Armor score so long as Excalibur is on their
                 person.</p>
                <p>Excalibur’s final feature is also its most noteworthy: at any time
                 while the user is holding it, they can choose to instantly engulf the blade in ice,
                 fire, lightning, acid, venom, or psychic energy. Whichever they choose, the sword 
                 deals one extra die of damage of the appropriate type: freeze for ice, burn for
                 fire, electric for lightning, caustic for acid, poison for venom, or psychic for 
                 psychic energy. So, if Excalibur were to become a dagger engulfed in flame, attacks
                 made with it would deal 5d4 physical + 1d4 burning damage.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Should Excalibur be wielded by a leader – such as
                 someone with royal blood or an elected ruler – its true power unlocks.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> Once awakened, Excalibur’s power 
                 increases the user’s previously chosen ability score by another .5 (up to 6), and it
                 can now change form instantly. Additionally, the user’s proficiency when wielding 
                 Excalibur increases to 6, as does the bonus to its attacks.  The initiative bonus 
                 also increases to +1d12, and the +3 Armor bonus becomes +6. The last change is that
                 the damage of the chosen engulfment increases to two extra damage dice.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> Somewhere in the world, legend tells of a lake
                 from whence Excalibur was gifted to its original wielder, whose name and deeds have
                 been lost to time. Many scholars and mythologists believe that, should Excalibur be 
                 returned to this lake, it would disappear from the world forever, never to be seen or
                 used again. Throwing the sword into the lake requires a successful DR 30 Willpower 
                 save; should the user fail the save, they must wait 24 hours before they can try 
                 again.</p>

                <p><b>Lore.</b> Bound in Sentient flesh and inked in Sentient blood, the Book of
                 the Dead is the sum culmination of an insane warlock's studies, knowledge, 
                 worship, and contact with various beings from the Unknown Plane. As such,
                 as the receptor for such vile and corrupting alien energies, the Necronomicon
                 is an unmatched collection of otherworldly knowledge and power, its power
                 having grown so great as to gain a corrupting will of its own.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> The Necronomicon bestows 1 Minor Boon, 1 Major Boon,
                 2 Minor Curses, and 1 Major Curse, as well as a new 
                 <a href="../Part6/Chapter17.html">madness</a> that cannot be cured while attuned
                 to the book. Upon awakening, it bestows 1 more Minor Boon,
                 1 more Minor Curse, 1 more Major Curse, and another incurable 
                 <a href="../Part6/Chapter17.html">madness</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> The Necronomicon is a sentient grimoire chock-full of evil,
                 eldritch, otherworldy spells, containing 10 + 1d10
                 <a href="../Part4/Spellcasting.html">otherworldly spells</a> (some of which can be
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a> spells), and 20 Mana with
                 which to cast them; exactly which spells are up to the GM. While attuned, the 
                 Necronomicon is telepathically linked to the user, and will corrupt them and
                 bid them toward vile deeds as frequently as it sees fit.</p>
                <p>Another property of the Necronomicon is that, while attuned, any spell 
                 the user casts through it has a 10% chance of misfiring.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> There are a handful of passages within the Necronomicon so
                 absolutely vile and corrupting that simply reading them aloud has a tangible
                 effect on both the user and the tome itself, awakening it.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> Upon awakening, 1d10 more spells appear or become
                 readable to the user in the tome.
                 Secondly, the chances of a spell misfiring when cast through the book increases to 15%.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the overpowering will of the book itself becomes stronger as well:
                 whenever the Necronomicon bids the user to perform its bidding, the user must 
                 succeed on a DR 20 Willpower save or perform the desired action; every time this
                 save is failed, the DR increases by 1.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> By otherworldly powers the Necronomicon was created, and
                 so by those same eldritch forces it must be undone: should the Necronomicon be
                 consumed by an Other or subjected to 500 points of damage from otherworldly spells,
                 it will be destroyed and wiped from this 
                 universe forever. Other worlds' Necronomicons, however...</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Philosopher's Stone</button>
            <div class="content">
            <br>
                <p><b>Lore.</b> The Magnum Opus, the Elixir of Life, the White Stone; the 
                 Philosopher’s Stone goes by all of these names and many more. Considered the 
                 absolute pinnacle of alchemy, the Stone holds the power to make nigh-undying
                 emporers of those who can master its power. It is unknown when or how the Stone
                 was forged, and all attempts to replicate it have failed, but many historians
                 and archaeologists have found material that suggests doing so
                 requires the sacrifice of living beings.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> The Philosopher’s Stone bestows the 
                 following boons and curses: 2 Minor Boons, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curse, 1 Major 
                 Curse. Upon awakening, it bestows 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> One of the most well-known and widely misrepresented
                 features of the Philosopher’s Stone is that it can permanently transform any 
                 substance, regardless of physical makeup, into any other substance of any other
                 physical makeup (popularized as "turning lead into gold", though the Stone 
                 could turn any substance into gold, or anything else for that matter).</p>
                <p>Upon attuning to the Stone, the user’s proficiency with Alchemy Tools 
                 immediately increases by 3, up to 6. While the Stone is in their immediate 
                 possession, they can brew any concoction without the need for non-Aether
                 resources in half the time; likewise, enchanting items takes half as long as it
                 normally would.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Stone has 25 Mana, which the user can use to cast the <i>Shape
                 Matter</i> spell, with the following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Casting Time is only 1 action;</li>
                    <li>The Area of Effect is a 5-meter cube;</li>
                    <li>The Range increases to 20 meters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The third property of the Stone is that through it, the user can transmute flesh to both
                 heal wounds and extend their own life. In addition to the <i>Shape Matter</i> spell, the
                 user can also use an action and expend <u>></u>1 Mana to restore 1d10 Health to any living
                 creature they can touch; for every 1 extra Mana they spend to do this, the amount of Health
                 they restore increases by 1d10 - this does not restore missing organs or appendages, but 
                 will seal fatal wounds. The Stone regains all 25 Mana at midnight. 
                 Additionally, the Stone slows the user’s aging process; while attuned to it,
                 the user ages 1 year for every 10 years that pass.</p>
                <p>Fourth and lastly, the knowledge the Stone imparts increases the user’s INT 
                 score by .5, to a maximum of 6, and increases their Arcana and Nature proficiencies by 1,
                 up to 6.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Awakening the Philosopher’s Stone requires that which it does best:
                 transmutation. Should the user spend all of the Stone's Mana on casting the <i>Shape
                 Matter</i> spell 10 times, the Stone will awaken.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> When the Stone awakens, the Mana at its
                 disposal increases to 30, all of which it regains at midnight; it can now also
                 replenish the Health of any creature that has died within 24 hours and restore
                 lost organs and appendages (if the target's soul is unable or unwilling to return
                 to its body, the body will be revived as a 
                 <a href="../../Bestiary/Sentients.html">Revenant</a>). It also further increases the user’s
                 INT score by another .5, up to 6, and increases their Arcana, Nature, and Alchemy Supplies
                 proficiencies by another 1, up to 6.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> Should the Stone be consumed by a pregnant 
                 Sentient, that child will be born a Rebus - a hermaphroditic 2nd level
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a>
                 and <a href="../Part3/Elementia.html">Space Elementia</a>, with an 
                 additional amount of Mana at their disposal equal to half their <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>
                 level, rounded up; additionally, the Rebus will live 10 times longer than they 
                 otherwise would. When the Rebus dies, the Philosopher’s Stone is destroyed. If the
                 pregnancy does not come to term, such as through an abortion, miscarriage, or 
                 stillbirth, then the Sentient who ingested the Stone will vomit it back up when the
                 fetus dies.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Titan Scale</button>
            <div class="content">
            <br>
                <p><b>Lore.</b> Beings with power second only to the gods, Titans are creatures of 
                 immense power and colossal size, of which only a handful have ever existed, and even
                 fewer have been killed; to say that this is an incredibly difficult feat would be a
                 massive understatement, but it is not impossible. However, when they are killed, 
                 that then allows the slayer to take one or more of their scales as a trophy, which
                 themselves contain a fragment of the Titan’s power. Over time, a Titan’s body rots 
                 away and decays, and only two remnants of their existence remain: their skeletons,
                 which are monumental in and of themselves; and fragments of their scales, which are
                 occasionally found and dug up, granting their wielder the powers of a Titan.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> A Titan Scale bestows the following boons
                 and curses: 1 Minor Boon, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curses, and 1 Major Curse. Upon 
                 awakening, it bestows 1 more Minor Boon and 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> When the user attunes to a Scale, it becomes 
                 part of their body as it embeds itself in their flesh. In so doing, it imparts
                 several of the Titan’s powers to the user, and for all of them except the STR 
                 increase and Drake fluency, the Scale has 3 charges at its disposal to use them; it
                 regains all of the expended charges at midnight.</p>
                <p>The first and second of these powers immediately increases the 
                 user’s STR score to 5 (or increases it by .5, up to 6, if the user’s STR score is 
                 already 5 or 5.5) and makes them fluent in Drake if they weren’t already.</p>
                <p>The third and more noteworthy power is the Titan’s breath weapon. 
                 There are 6 possible breath weapons: acid, fire, ice, lightning, psychic energy, and
                 poison; the obtainer of the Scale gains use of one of these (GM’s choice). At the 
                 cost of 2 actions and 1 charge, the user can choose to exhale a stream of their
                 breath weapon in either a 16m line or an 8m cone. In either case, every 
                 creature caught in the blast takes 6d6 of the appropriate damage (caustic for acid,
                 burn for fire, freeze for ice, electric for lightning, psychic for psychic energy, 
                 and poison for poison).</p>
                <p>The fourth and final power is the Titan’s flight, which manifests 
                 as a pair of magnificent wings that sprout from the user’s back at the cost of 2 
                 actions and 1 charge. These wings grant the user a flying speed of 16m for 1 hour.</p>
                <p>The last property of the Scale is not a power of the Titan’s, but
                 more its mark. When the user attunes to the Scale, in several random places on their
                 body, scales of the Titan’s color begin to grow (black, blue, green, purple, red, or
                 white), increasing the user’s Armor score by 2.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Should the user obtain and “attune” to a second 
                 Scale from the same Titan, the Scale will awaken.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> When the Scale awakens, the user’s STR
                 score becomes 6 if it wasn’t already, and the Scale gains 3 more charges with which
                 to use its powers. Additionally, each of the powers undergoes the following changes:
                 the breath weapon’s range increases to 30m (line)/15m (cone), 
                 and the damage increases to 8d8; the flight speed increases to 20m; the
                 scales grow, becoming thicker and covering more of your body, increasing your Armor score 
                 by another 2; and lastly, your Intimidation proficiency increases by 1, up to 6, as
                 the might and sheer power of the Titan fills your body, mind, and soul.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> A Scale can only be destroyed by another 
                 Titan’s breath. A Scale has 50 Health (100 if awakened) separate from the user, and
                 should the user be hit by another Titan’s breath weapon, any damage they take is 
                 likewise applied to the Scale. If the Scale’s Health is reduced to 0, it shatters, 
                 and the scales that have grown on the user’s body rot and fall off.</p>
