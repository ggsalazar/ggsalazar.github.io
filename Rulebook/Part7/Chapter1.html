            <h2>What is Aether?</h2>
            <p>Aether is a truly wondrous substance – or rather, a collection of substances with
             powerful and unique properties. It is the physical manifestation of the six elements, 
             and though not used for much, what it is used for is the foundation of the world,
             history, and workings of the world of Aethra (occasionally used as an example
             herein) and the I&A ruleset.</p>
             
            <h2>Types of Aether – The Six Elements</h2>
            <p>There are six types of Aether in existence, one for each element, and they are 
             all briefly described here. Each element is further divided into two sub-elements, and when
             these sub-elements intermingle, pseudo-elements are formed; both of these are described
             in full later on.</p>
            <p><b>Dark.</b> The element of emptiness, silence, the void, and all the secrets that lie within;
             its sub-elements are Void and Frost. Darkness is Light’s complement, and without it all would be
             just as blind as though there were darkness without light. Dark Aether is a deep black with 
             occasional hints of blue.</p>
            <p><b>Light.</b> The element of knowledge, of hope, of the sun shining through the trees on a 
             beautiful day; its sub-elements are Radiance and Fire. Light cannot exist without its
             counterpart, darkness, as they are co-dependent on each other to maintain harmony in the 
             universe. Light Aether is a bright white with hints of yellow and red.</p>
            <p><b>Magic.</b> The element of illusions and power, of wonder, lies, and all which is not as it
             seems and does not act as it should; its sub-elements are Illusion and Force. Magic is believed
             to be the source of all creativity, and who is to say those who believe such are wrong? Magic
             Aether is purple and glimmers frequently.</p>
            <p><b>Soul.</b> The element responsible for everything that lives and dies, it is Soul that creates
             that spark that generates life in the universe - and it is Soul that necessitates that all life must
             come to an end; its sub-elements are Life and Death. Soul Aether varies from an ethereal green to a
             sickly grey.</p>
            <p><b>Space.</b> The element of all which physically exists and has matter; its sub-elements are
             Earth and Air. Space Aether is clear and translucent, and appears to shift and obscure the area
             immediately around and behind it.</p>
            <p><b>Time.</b> Flowing ever-forward like a river, Time ensures everything in the universe keeps
             moving, progressing, improving, deteriorating; whatever its natural course may be, Time ensures             
             everything will meet its destiny when it is meant to, and its sub-elements are Possibility and
             Reality. Time Aether is also clear and translucent, however everything around it seems to move
             a bit more quickly or slowly than it should.</p>
            
            <h2>The Sub-Elements</h2>
            <p>Each of the six elements has two distinct aspects - the two sides of the proverbial elemental
             coin. These sub-elements represent the two halves of the whole element, creating a Yin and Yang
             of primordial power that, when combined, form the fundamental force of nature that is the 
             element itself. When one sub-element "interacts" with an adjacent sub-element, that interaction
             creates a pseudo-element; these are explained in greater detail in the next 
             section. Given here is a brief explanation of the sub-elements themselves, arranged by adjancency
             rather than alphabetically.</p>
            <p><b>Light-Fire.</b> The aspect of Light that provides heat, its presence can be both comforting
             and horribly painful; it is adjacent to Magic-Force, creating the Lightning pseudo-element.</p>
            <p><b>Light-Radiance.</b> The part of Light that is pure, well, light, illuminating but also blinding;
             it is adjacent to Dark-Void, creating the Twilight pseudo-element.</p>
            <p><b>Dark-Void.</b> The pure, unyielding blackness of Dark, blinding, but also protecting and
             comforting in its privacy; it is adjacent to Light-Radiance, forming Twilight.</p>
            <p><b>Dark-Frost.</b> The cold aspect of Dark, chilling to the bone and cruelly biting those caught
             unprepared; it is adjacent to Soul-Death, forming the pseudo-element Decay.</p>
            <p><b>Soul-Death.</b> The part of Soul that brings about the end of all living things, ensuring
             that, for better or worse, nothing lasts forever; it is adjacent to Dark-Frost, manifesting into
             Decay.</p>
            <p><b>Soul-Life.</b> The aspect of Soul that animates and bestows willpower, autonomy, self-awareness
             into an otherwise dull and stagnant universe; it is adjacent to Space-Earth, creating Water.</p>
            <p><b>Space-Earth.</b> A bit of a misnomer, Space-Earth does not just refer to actual dirt and soil,
             but all the solid physical material of the universe; it is adjacent to Soul-Life, making up one-half 
             of the Water pseudo-element.</p>
            <p><b>Space-Air.</b> The part of Space that refers to all that which is not occupied by physical material;
             it is adjacent to Time-Reality, forming the ephemeral pseudo-element of Memory.</p>
            <p><b>Time-Reality.</b> That which is happening and has happened, forever part of this universe's
             history; it is adjacent to Space-Air, manifesting in the pseudo-element of Memory.</p>
            <p><b>Time-Possibility.</b> That which has not happened but may, or which didn't happen but could
             have, if things had been just a bit different; it is adjacent to Magic-Illusion, forming the
             pseudo-element of Prophecy.</p>
            <p><b>Magic-Illusion.</b> The duplicitous aspect of the ethereal Magic, displaying pure imagination and making
             fools and wonderers of those in its presence; it is adjacent to Time-Possibility, creating Prophecy.</p>
            <p><b>Magic-Force.</b> The solid and undeniable side of the powerful Magic, bending those who feel
             it to its will and forcing them to revel in its glory; it is adjacent to Light-Fire, forming Lightning.</p>
             
            <h2>The Pseudo-Elements</h2>
            <p>All of the elements are, in a sense, related. They are the fundamental forces of the universe,
             forming its very core, its systems, its beating heart. They are like the siblings of one big
             cosmic family - and much like actual siblings, some are closer with each other than others; in
             a sense, they are "adjacent". Picture it like this: if the elements were to form a wheel or ring,
             they would be arranged thusly: Light-Dark-Soul-Space-Time-Magic-Light. Where the sub-elements 
             "meet" are the pseudo-elements, natural forces that bridge the gaps between the 
             elements, and in so doing are an intrinsic part of both of them, hence why Aetherians are able to
             cast spells derived from the pseudo-elements. Each of the pseudo-elements are explained in brief 
             here.</p>
            <p><b>Lightning (Light-Fire + Magic-Force).</b> When the pure scorching heat of Fire and the unyielding
             power of Force combine, Lightning is created, searing all in its path with its might.</p>
            <p><b>Twilight (Light-Radiance + Dark-Void).</b> When the day meets the night, and Light and Dark mingle
             in their supposed opposition, the glowing darkness and enshrouding light of Twilight comes to be.</p>
            <p><b>Decay (Dark-Frost + Soul-Death).</b> As things approach their end, they grow cold and begin to
             whither away, slowly succumbing to the forces of Decay.</p>
            <p><b>Water (Soul-Life + Space-Earth).</b> Life given form and structure, Water occurs when the
             ethereal nature of Soul and the physicality of Space combine.</p>
            <p><b>Memory (Space-Air + Time-Reality).</b> As that which was and has come to pass fades off into nothing,
             solidifying its place in the timeline of the universe, it becomes as ephemeral as the Air Sentients
             breathe, becoming Memory.</p>
            <p><b>Prophecy (Time-Possibility + Magic-Illusion).</b> When events that may yet be project themselves onto
             the imaginative and gossamer nature of Illusion, Prophecy is born.</p>
            
            <h2>Elemental Storms</h2>
            <p>Elemental Storms are, as the name would imply, storms that unleash in their fury the powers of
             one of the elements. What exactly triggers an Elemental Storm is up to the GM, but as an example,
             on Aethra the most common cause of Elemental Storms is when the barriers between the planes
             become worn thin in a given area, though what exactly causes <i>that</i> is still a mystery to
             Sentient minds. And who knows what may happen if one of those barriers were to break or wear
             away entirely...</p>
            <p>The nature of these storms varies according to the nature of the element: Light storms, for
             example, may involve blooms of sourceless light filling an area, fire falling from the sky like
             rain, lightning erupting out of nowhere; on the other hand, a Time storm may involve a group of
             people having visions of the past and/or future, suddenly growing older or younger, or skipping
             backwards or forwards in time. While bombardments of the element itself are to be naturally 
             expected, because all of the elements are, to some degree, omnipresent, the appropriate
             pseudo-elements will also make appearances during Elemental Storms, e.g. lightning will strike
             during both Light and Magic storms, heavy torrents of rain will fall during both Soul and Space
             storms, etc. In any case, Elemental Storms are usually quite dangerous
             and terrifying events, ranging from fractured buildings, minds, and/or bodies to cataclysmic
             losses of life and property in the affected area. Typically, these storms last from 1-6 days and
             cover up to 20 square kilometers.</p>
            <p>While Elemental Storms are incredibly dangerous, they are not without their benefits: the 
             bursts and manifestations of elemental power typically leave behind rich deposits of Aether, and
             children born during an Aether Storm have decent chances (about 20% each) of becoming
             <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> or <a href="../Part3/Specials.html">Elementia</a>
             of the corresponding element.</p>
            
            <h2>Forms of Aether</h2>
            <p>All types of Aether can take three forms: solid, which is typically crystalline 
             when pure or ore-like when impure; liquid, which is thin and water-like when pure 
             or thick and sludgy when impure; and gaseous, which is always thick and semi-opaque.
             Pure solid Aether is surprisingly edible, though most who wish to ingest it do 
             prefer to drink it when possible. One pound of solid Aether is roughly a few centimeters in
             diameter.</p>
            <p>To convert solid Aether into liquid, it must be crushed and ground into what 
             would normally be a fine and sprinkle-like dust, but in the case of Aether 
             liquifies and creates a liquid with the same volume as its solid counterpart. To
             convert liquid into gaseous, it must be boiled at a temperature of 100 degrees 
             Alchelite, the same that it takes to boil water; however, gaseous Aether is not hot
             and can be interacted with safely, though breathing it in for a few minutes is
             enough to induce Aether Sickness. Gaseous Aether cannot be converted into liquid,
             but it can be made solid by exposing it to a temperature of 0&#176;A (also the 
             freezing temperature of water).</p>
            <p><b>Alchelite (A).</b> Alchelite is the temperature-measuring metric in I&A. For
             simplicity, it is equal to the real-world metric of Celsius. Sentient body 
             temperature is 37&#176;A.</p>
            
            <h2>Aether Sickness</h2>
            <p>When one consumes or ingests any kind of pure Aether or injects it into their
             bloodstream, they become afflicted with Aether Sickness. Every day for the next 
             1d3+1 days, Aether Sickness reduces the afflicted creature’s Health by 20% of their
             maximum, during which time the afflicted is <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> 
             and cannot regain any Health by any means. If this disease brings the afflicted’s 
             Health down to 0, they must succeed on a DR 15 Fortitude Save or die as the Aether
             consumes them and transforms them into a monster of the corresponding Aether type,
             e.g. Magic Aether will create a <a href="../../Bestiary/Fae.html">Fae</a> or 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Vi.html">Vi</a>, Dark Aether will create a 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Hollow.html">Hollow</a> or 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Frozen.html">Frozen</a>, and so on.</p>
            <p>Should an <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a> ingest Aether in any
             way, if the Aether is not of the type that they have already bonded to, they will 
             invariably be riddled with Aether Sickness for the next day or two, during which 
             time they will intermittently vomit up the Aether they consumed in solid and/or
             liquid form. If it is of the type they have bonded with, then their Mana is 
             restored by an amount equal to 5 times the pounds of Aether that they
             consumed.</p>
            
            <h2>Where to Find It</h2>
            <p>Aether is found in a variety of places, but on the Central Plane it is most commonly found in
             four places:<br>
            1. In subterranean deposits rife with veins and "natural" clusters;<br>
            2. In large chunks and pillars found seemingly randomly throughout the world, such as quarries and
             great boulders;<br>
            3. In isolated lakes, ponds, natural fountains, and the like, again scattered seemingly at
             random throughout the world;<br>
            4. In the aftermath of Elemental Storms.</p>
            <p>Though most of these sources would at first appear finite in nature, it is not unknown for
             sources of Aether to - either spontaneously or over time - replenish themselves, or for new
             sources to appear where there previously were none. Additionally, each element's plane is
             absolutely plentiful with the corresponding type of Aether.</p>
            
            <h2>Where to Buy It</h2>
            <p>In the world of Aethra, the acquisition and distribution of Aether is typically 
             handled by whoever discovered it, or whoever is in control of a given source at any 
             given time. This may be the local government, a rich merchant, or some farmer who 
             discovered Aether growing in their crops. Each of these distributors may charge 
             different prices for the Aether in their possession, and at that point it is up to the
             GM to adjudicate exact prices. If a type of Aether is abundant in a given area, a good baseline
             for its price is 25A/pound, and this price would of course only increase as it became more rare
             and/or more desired by the buyer.</p>
            
            <h2>What it is Used For</h2>
            <p>Aether is a mysterious and powerful substance, and though its uses are actually quite limited,
             what it is used for is fundamental for Sentient societies, civilizations, and cultures.</p>
            <p>Aether’s most basic and fundamental use is the creation of 
             <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a>. Aside from that, Aether is primarily used
             in <a href="./Chapter2.html">alchemy</a>, though it has a tertiary use in the creation and decoration
             of jewelry - i.e., instead of using diamonds, rubies, or the like for shows of wealth and status,
             Sentients instead use Aether.</p>
            <p><b>Dark.</b> Dark Aether is used to brew concoctions and enchant items that create
             darkness, cause silence, curse with blindness, or inflict some sort of freezing effect.</p>
            <p><b>Light.</b> Light’s most common use is for the creation of light-emitting enchants, 
             particularly effective truth serums, and anything and everything to do with fire (Light and
             Magic together are required for lightning-based creations).</p>
            <p><b>Magic.</b> Magic Aether is very useful in the creation of deceitful, double-natured
             enchants, hallucinogenic poisons, and enchants that manipulate the forces of the world.</p>
            <p><b>Soul.</b> Soul is an incredibly versatile source of power, as it is used to both
             create Health potions to restore life and various poisons to end it.</p>
            <p><b>Space.</b> Space Aether is incredibly versatile in the world of alchemy, being used in 
             enchants that both bestow strength, fortitude, and durability, and in those that grant the
             ability to fly, enhance one's reflexes, or allow one to breathe safely when they otherwise
             would not be.</p>
            <p><b>Time.</b> Used in the creation of hasting and slowing concoctions, time-manipulating
             enchanted items, and items and tinctures that bestow visions of the past or future. Also used to
             create exceptionally accurate clocks.</p>
            
            <h2>Aether Effects on Non-Sentients</h2>
            <p>When ingested by a non-Sentient creature such as a Beast, the Aether will corrupt their body
             and turn them into a creature of the corresponding Aether type, e.g. consuming Light Aether will
             create a <a href="../../Bestiary/Radiant.html">Radiant</a> or 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Scorched.html">Scorched</a>, Soul Aether will create an
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Undead.html">Undead</a> or 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/Unliving.html">Unliving</a>, etc.</p>
            
            <h2 id="Antitherium">Anti-Aether - Antitherium</h2>
            <p>Antitherium is a special metal that nullifies the arcane powers and effects of Aether. 
             Generally, when Antitherium is used to forge something or integrated into something's 
             construction, it will nullify any arcane effects that occur inside of or adjacent to the
             object. For example, a building built with Antitherium will negate any and all spells cast
             inside it, nor can it be teleported into or out of. Manacles, shackles, or collars made of 
             Antitherium may prevent Aetherians (or other spellcasting creatures) from casting spells 
             entirely, depending on the placement and number of the restraints and the concentration of 
             Antitherium in them.</p>
            <p>Armor made of Antitherium will grant the wearer advantage on saves against spell effects, as
             well as grant casters disadvantage on damage rolls against the wearer. Weapons made of 
             Antitherium are a truly interesting case - for one, casters have disadvantage on saves to 
             maintain Concentration when struck with such a weapon; for two, if an Aetherian is reduced to 0
             Health or otherwise qualifies for a Lingering Injury when hit with an Antitherium weapon, they
             may suffer an effect that debilitates their ability to cast spells for some length of time (e.g.
             1d6 days). Some examples are: not being able to cast spells at all, not being able to maintain 
             Concentration, having their maximum Mana temporarily reduced, or possibly even losing an 
             Aetherian level.</p>
            <p>For mechanical intents and purposes (e.g. blacksmithing), consider Antitherium equal to steel.</p>
