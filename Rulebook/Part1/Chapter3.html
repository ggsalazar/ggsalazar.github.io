            <p>In I&A, there are three types of skills: <a href="./Chapter2.html">Action
             Skills, Tool Skills, and Weapon Skills</a>. <b>Action Skills</b> are skills that 
             are used to perform certain actions, such as climbing, stealing, sneaking, 
             performing, etc. <b>Tool Skills</b> measure one’s familiarity and talent with a 
             specific set of tools, such as Art Supplies or Woodcarving Kits. <b>Weapon Skills</b>
             are skills that directly relate to the use of certain types of weapons, e.g. Small,
             Polearm, Exotic, etc. But how does one become adept in these skills, and how does a
             character’s adeptness in a given skill result in their ability to meet the 
             challenges presented to them?</p>
            <p>Adeptness with a specific skill is referred to as <b>proficiency</b>: for Action 
             and Tool Skills, it increases through the use of Skill Points, or SP, and it takes
             1 SP for proficiency with an Action or Tool Skill to increase by 1. Proficiency with
             Weapon Skills, on the other hand, increases as characters gain levels, as shown in the
             tables below.</p>
             
            <h2>Proficiency Descriptions</h2>
            <p>To give a better idea of what each level of proficiency means, a descriptor is
             given here for each level of proficiency.</p>
            </p><b>0: Novice.</b> You have no knowledge of what you're doing or how to do it.</p>
            </p><b>1: Amateur.</b> You have some basic knowledge of what you're doing but you're
             still very inexperienced and unfamiliar with it.</p>
            </p><b>2: Journeyman.</b> You've achieved a measure of competency with what you're 
             doing, enough to perform some difficult tasks when the stars align just right.</p>
            </p><b>3: Adept.</b> You're starting to get pretty good with what you're doing, and 
             on a good day can succeed on harder tasks.</p>
            </p><b>4: Expert.</b> You're very, very good at what you're doing, certainly better
             than almost everyone you've met. You're able to perform difficult tasks with some
             regularity.</p>
            </p><b>5: Master.</b> You are among the absolute best at what you're doing, and will
             rarely if ever meet anyone who is as good or better than you are.</p>
            </p><b>6: Grandmaster.</b> You have surpassed normal Sentient ability, and are truly
             the best at what you're doing. Though some tasks do present trials to you, you are
             still able to perform them with just a little bit of luck.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that the above only applies to Sentients, and other creatures 
            can go up to 10 in their proficiencies, like with Ability Scores.</p>
            
            <h2>Skill Checks and Proficiency</h2>
            <p>When making an Action Skill check, roll a number of d10s equal to your proficiency
             in the given skill and add the appropriate Ability Score to the rolls (e.g. you add your DEX 
             score when making a Sleight of Hand check). If you have 0 proficiency in a skill, roll a d6 and
			 add the appropriate score. Tool Skills are very similar, except that the bonus to the roll is 
			 not tied to a particular Ability Score and is instead up to your GM's discretion depending on
			 what you are doing.</p>
            <p>You can use 1 SP to increase proficiency with an Action or Tool Skill by 1, to a 
             maximum of 5 unless otherwise stated by a special exception such as a class feature. At
             1st level, each character starts with 1 proficiency in each Action Skill, and their 
             <a href="../Part2/Chapter1.html">Background</a> (and possibly Heritage) will grant them
             proficiency in a few more; additionally, 1 SP is gained whenever you level up. 
             <a href="./Chapter1.html">Partial Successes and Check Difficulty</a> also apply to Action
             and Tool Skill checks.</p>
            
            <h2>Weapon Proficiency and Scaling</h2>
            <p>For Weapon Skills, proficiency is a direct measure of how many damage dice you roll when
             attacking with a given weapon, but unlike Action Skills, every weapon has its own base damage
             die. If your proficiency with a weapon is 0, you roll the base damage die and divide the result
             by 2, then add your STR or DEX score, depending on the weapon; if your proficiency is <u>></u> 1,
             you roll a number of damage dice equal to your proficiency then add your STR or DEX.</p>
            <p>For example, let’s say Lailyn the Warrior has 3 proficiency with Medium weapons and 1
             proficiency with Large weapons. On her turn in combat, she chooses to attack an Ork with
             her flail. A flail’s base damage is 1d6, but because Lailyn has 3 proficiency in Medium
             weapons, she would instead roll 3d6 and add her STR score to the result. On the other
             hand, if Lailyn chose to slash at the Ork with a claymore, she would instead roll the 
             base 1d8 then add her STR.</p>
            <p><b>Weapons Proficiency.</b> Like with Action Skills, every character starts with 1 
             proficiency in every Weapon Skill. However, at 1st Level, a character will select a single 
             Weapon Skill (or 2 for Warriors) to gain proficiency in as they level up (except Aetherians, who
             by default gain proficiency in Aether). The table here shows how a character gains that 
             proficiency with their chosen Weapon Skill(s) as they increase in level. When multi-classing, 
             use your <u>total</u> number of levels when determining your Weapons Proficiency (this does not
             apply to Aether Proficiency - only levels in Aetherian count for that).</p>

            <p><b>Skill Checks Using Weapons.</b> In the event that a character attempts a non-combat related
             task using one of their weapons - such as using their ranged weapon to hit a far-away object -
             have the character roll a number of d10s equal to their proficiency with that weapon and then add
             the appropriate Ability Score, like you would with an Action Skill check.</p> 
            
            <h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
            <p>Whenever the term advantage is used, it means that by some stroke of luck or 
             fortunate circumstance, a character has gotten a particularly strong hit against an 
             opponent or has some sort of situational expertise with the skill they are performing or
             the tools they are using. Mechanically, this means that half (rounded up) of the dice 
             the player must roll are automatically taken at their highest value.</p>
            <p>For example, say that Sandor the Warrior, who has 3 proficiency with Polearm
             weapons, decides to strike an <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> 
             enemy with his halberd. Normally, Sandor would roll 3d6 + his STR score to 
             determine the damage he deals; however, because he has advantage, he instead rolls
             1d6 + 12 + his STR.</p>
            <p>Disadvantage is very similar conceptually, except that half (rounded up) of the 
             dice to be rolled are automatically taken at their lowest value. To extend on the 
             above example, this would mean that Sandor instead deals 1d6 + 2 + his STR score
             damage.</p>
            <p>Should a character have both advantage and disadvantage in a situation, they cancel each other
             out and the rolls are made normally. If they have multiple sources of advantage, all of the dice
             they would normally roll are taken at their highest value, while if they have multiple sources of
             disadvantage, all of the dice they would normally roll are taken at their lowest value.</p>
