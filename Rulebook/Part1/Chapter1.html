            <p>The seven ability scores – Strength, Constitution, Agility, Dexterity, 
             Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma – are numerical representations of a 
             creature’s physical and mental attributes, and they determine its aptitude in 
             certain fields and its ability to perform a given activity. They are measured 
             from 0 to 10, with the average score for a normal adult Sentient being 2. The 
             highest a Sentient’s score can go up to by natural means is 5, but certain 
             class features, enchanted items, special abilities, or other exceptional means 
             can bring a score up to 6. Each is described in detail below.</p>

                    <br>
                        Strength is the measure of your character’s ability to push, pull, or exert any 
                        raw physical force on the world around them. It is used to muscle your way through 
                        certain situations and deal damage with most melee weapons. STR is also used to determine 
                        a creature’s <a href="./Chapter8.html">carrying capacity</a> before 
                        becoming encumbered. A creature that is encumbered (meaning they have surpassed their 
                        carrying capacity) is <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">slowed</a> and cannot climb,
                        swim, or jump. If they have surpassed their carrying capacity by <u>></u> 150% (e.g. your 
                        carrying capacity is 100 and you’re carrying 150+ pounds) then they are 
                        <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">incapacitated</a>. Your STR also partially 
                        determines your <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a>.

                        Constitution measures your body’s overall fortitude and toughness, as well as your 
                         stamina and your ability to resist the effects of poison and disease. CON is used 
                         when determining your <a href="./Chapter4.html">Health</a> and
                         <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a>. Any time your CON increases/decreases,
                         you gain/lose an amount of Maximum Health equal to the change times your level;
                         for example, if your CON increases from 3 to 3.5 and you are level 5, your Maximum
                         Health immediately increases by .5 times 5, which is 2.5.

                        Agility measures a character's ability to move quickly and perform body-wide feats
                         of finesse, whereas DEX is more closely tied to hand-eye coordination and precise, 
                         nimble movements using one's hands and feet. Your AGI or DEX score determines your 
                         initiative, and AGI and DEX together measure one's <a href="./Chapter5.html">Dodge</a>
                         and <a href="./Chapter6.html">Reflex</a> scores.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Speed.</b> AGI also modifies your speed: for every .5 above 0 that
                         a creature's AGI increases, they gain another .25 meters/second to
                         their speed. For example, a Medium creature (Base Move 2m/sec) with an AGI of 
                         3.5 would have a speed of 3.75 meters/sec; conversely, a Medium creature with an AGI
                         of 1 would only have a speed of 2.5 meters/sec.

                         is used when precision is called for and helps in determining a

                         increases, the time it takes them to perform all actions is 
                         reduced by .5 seconds, to a minimum of .5 seconds for non-trivial

            <h2>Determining Your Scores</h2>
            <p>Given here are two ways to determine your scores, though your group may decide to 
             modify one of these ways or come up with one of their own:</p>
            <p><b>Roll 1d8/2 7 Times.</b> The first method is to roll 1d8 and divide the roll by 2; record
             the result, then do that 6 more times, once for each score. Once you have all 7, place each
             digit into each Ability Score as you desire.</p>
            <p><b>Point Buy.</b> The second method allows you to "purchase" your Ability Scores using a pool
             of 16 points via a 1:1 conversion rate (e.g. you can spend 2.5 points to get a score of 2.5).
             You cannot buy a score higher than 4.</p>
            <p>When deciding stats, it is heavily recommended that your group democratically decide
             which method they wish to use. Ability Scores can be halfway between two whole
             numbers (1.5, 2.5, etc.) but cannot be any other non-whole value.</p>
            
            <h2>Skill Bonuses</h2>
            <p>Each Ability Score also doubles as a bonus to each associated skill, which simply
             means that when making a check on one of those skills, you add your Ability Score 
             to the result of that check.</p>
            
            <h2>Skill and Ability Checks</h2>
            <p>In I&A, when a character wishes to perform any sort of difficult 
             or complex action, they must make what is called a <b>skill check</b>. If the action 
             they wish to perform directly relates/corresponds to an <a href="./Chapter2.html">Action Skill</a> 
             they are proficient in, they must roll a number of d10s proportionate to their
             <a href="./Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> in that skill. However, if they are attempting
             something that does not fit the criteria for any of the Action Skills, then 
             they make what is called an <b>ability check</b>. To do this, simply roll a number of 
             d10s equal to the appropriate Ability Score (plus a d6 if the score is halfway between two
             whole numbers) and add up the rolls, plus the score itself; if
             the result is <u>></u> the DR, you succeed. If the given Ability Score is 0 or 0.5, just
             roll 1d6.</p>
            <p>For both skill checks and ability checks, consider reducing the DR based on how
             your players describe how they wish to perform the action; if they explicitly point
             out that they are going out of their way to make what they are attempting easier or
             if they roleplay the check well, the DR should be reduced accordingly.</p>
            <p><b>Partial Successes.</b> Instead of having success or failure be a binary,
             consider implementing the following: if a character fails a check by a relatively
             small amount, they achieve a Partial Success, which allows the character to make
             progress towards their goal without explicitly succeeding, usually granting them 
             the opportunity to make an additional check to try to further their progress
             towards/meet their goal (if you are uncertain as to how to implement a Partial
             Success for a given task, consider simply having them eventually succeed after
             attempting the task for a long time).<br>
            <p><b>Check Difficulty.</b> Presented here are two tables that should give an idea
             of the relative difficulty of various tasks. GMs can use either table at their 
             discretion: the left gives a list of static difficulties that can be referenced
             quickly and easily, while the right outlines how to calculate dynamic DRs given a
             task's difficulty.</p>

            <h2>Deciding When a Roll Is(n't) Needed</h2>
            <p>As Ability Scores (and skill proficiencies) become higher and higher, the need to roll for
             certain activities - Very Easy and Easy ones in particular - becomes lesser and lesser. If a
             character with a high enough Ability Score or skill proficiency is attempting a relatively easy
             task, then there is no need to call for a roll, and it can just be assumed that the character is
             able to perform the task. For example, if a
             character with 5 STR tries to break a somewhat thick piece of wood (DR 10), then it can be safely assumed
             that they are able to do this quite easily, and there is no need to ask the
             player to roll on behalf of their character. This has the dual benefit of both keeping the game
             moving, and rewarding the character for specializing in a given ability/skill to such a degree.</p>
            <p>Contrarily, if there is no possible way for a character to succeed at a task given their 
             current Ability Score/proficiency, then there is no reason to make them roll, and you can simply
             say that if the character tries, there is no way for them to succeed. As an example, if a
             character with 1 proficiency in Lore wanted to see if they knew an extremely obscure piece of
             information (DR 40), there is simply no way for them to succeed on that check, so it would be
             pointless to ask for a roll. Whether or not the <i>character</i> would realize they aren't skilled
             enough to attempt something would largely depend on their INT/WIS score.</p>
