            <p>Skills of all kinds are necessary to not just an adventuring party’s survival, but
             their success as well. In this chapter are described, in detail, each and every one of 
             the skills in I&A, as well as a brief treatise on how to increase your 
             <a href="./Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> with them.</p>
            
            <h2>Action Skills</h2>
            <p>Action Skills are used whenever you want to perform certain actions in the world 
             around you. There are a wide variety of skills used to perform a wide variety of actions,
             and they have each been categorized under one of the seven Ability Scores and are 
             detailed below. Every character at level 1 starts 1 proficiency in each Action Skill,
             and your <a href="../Part2/Chapter1.html">Background</a> (and possibly your Heritage)
             will grant you a few more proficiencies, though you can always gain proficiency in more
             as time goes on.</p>
            <p>To make an Action Skill check, simply roll the same number of d10s as your proficiency
             in the skill, then add the appropriate Ability Score; if the result is <u>></u> the DR of the
             check, then you succeed! If your
             proficiency with a skill is 0, then just roll 1d6
             and add the appropriate score. Though most Action Skills use the Ability Score it is
             categorized under, there are times when the GM might require you to make a skill check
             using a different score. In these instances, you still roll the appropriate 
             number of d10s, however instead of adding the score you would normally use, you instead
             add the score specified by the GM.</p>
            <p>It takes 1 Skill Point (SP) to increase your proficiency with an Action Skill,
             and all Action Skills have a proficiency cap of 5, though like Ability Scores, special features
             can increase this cap to 6. You gain 1 SP every time you 
             level up.</p>

                    <br>
                        The purposes of the Climb and Swim skills are twofold: the first is to 
                         give their user a climbing/swimming speed equal to double their 
                         proficiency + double their STR score, and the second is to be able to
                         climb or swim in difficult situations or whenever a significant 
                         challenge to the activity is present.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Climb.</b> Climb checks are needed whenever a creature faces a 
                         challenge in scaling a relatively vertical surface, such as the rope they’re 
                         climbing being cut, some force shaking the wall the are hanging onto, or a creature
                         attempting to pull them off the surface they are scaling.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Swim.</b> Swim checks are required whenever a non-aquatic 
                         creature attempts to swim through troubled waters or other difficult situations, 
                         such as upstream, in a storm, or with another creature on their back.

                    <br>
                        <b>Sleight of Hand.</b> Sleight of Hand checks are required whenever a creature 
                         attempts to perform some sort of trickery or deceitful maneuver with their hands. 
                         Some examples include pickpocketing, planting an object, or concealing something on
                         your person.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Stealth.</b> Stealth is used whenever a creature attempts to 
                         conceal themselves from others or hide in their surroundings. Some examples include
                         hiding from pursuers, camouflaging oneself using the terrain, or sneaking past an
                         unaware enemy. Stealth checks should be contested by the opposing party’s Perception
                         checks.

                    <br>
                        <b>Arcana.</b> Arcana is used when studying enchanted items, concoctions, and 
                         other arcane effects such as eldritch glyphs or a sampling of <a href="../Part7/Chapter1.html">Aether</a>.
                         Some examples include checking for arcane traps, determining the properties of an 
                         enchanted item, or figuring out what effect a given concoction will have.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Lore.</b> The Lore skill is used when you wish to discern or 
                         recall more information about a specific part of the world. Perhaps you wish to 
                         remember the history behind a specific enchanted item, recall the role a specific 
                         location played in some event, or are trying to learn who the leader of a given 
                         region of land is.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Mechanics.</b> Mechanics is used to discern how a machine works
                         and what it is designed to do. Passing a Mechanics check will allow a character to 
                         understand the workings of a machine and/or its components, or allow them to alter 
                         its function in a desired way – provided they have the necessary tools, components,
                         and ability to do so.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Medicine.</b> The Medicine skill tells of your ability to discern and diagnose
                         various illnesses or the nature and effects of grisly wounds. Additionally, your 
                         proficiency in Medicine Kits is equal to your proficiency in Medicine -1. The
                         uses for Medicine Kits are detailed below, under "Tool Skills". Lastly, Medicine
                         can be used to harvest crafting parts and Alchemy Ingredients from creatures you slay, though when this skill
                         is used in that way, you add your DEX to the check instead of your INT.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Nature.</b> Nature is used whenever you want to recall 
                         information on a specific aspect of something found in the natural world, such as a
                         creature, plant, or gas. Examples include learning about a specific breed of beast,
                         remembering information about a monster in the middle of a fight, or identifying the
                         effects of a gas.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Theology.</b> Theology measures your knowledge of the religions
                         and spiritual practices of the world. Some examples of Theology checks include 
                         recognizing the religious hierarchies of a cult, remembering the primary deity of a
                         specific religion, or inferring the proper religious gestures to make at certain 
                         times.

                    <br>
                        <b>Appraisal.</b> Appraisal is used to discern the monetary value of 
                         items, and if they might be worth more to some people than to others; it is also
                         used to determine a weapon's quality. 
                         Some examples include figuring out the worth or rarity of a gem, how much an ancient
                          artifact would fetch for, or what the quality of a given weapon is.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Beast Handling.</b> Beast Handling comes into play whenever you
                         attempt to gain control of or domesticate a beast. Hungry, scared, or angry beasts
                         will require higher Beast Handling checks than beasts that have been 
                         calmed or placated in some way.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Insight.</b> Insight is used when trying to discern someone’s true 
                         motives, emotions, or current mental state. Examples include telling if someone is 
                         lying, determining how someone feels about received news, or determining whether or not
                         someone is presently hostile to you.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Navigation.</b> Navigation is used to find your way and prevent
                         yourself from getting lost, especially in unfamiliar terrain. Examples include 
                         navigating rough waters, finding your way through a foreign swamp, and forging your
                         way up a mountain. Navigation is also used when <a href="../Part6/Chapter8.html">traveling</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Perception.</b> Perception determines your ability to - unsurprisingly - perceive 
                         the goings-on in the world around you and not get caught unawares. If a character or
                         player wishes to, they can specify which sense they want to focus their perceptions
                         on, such as seeing, hearing, smelling, etc., which may give them advantage or 
                         nullify the disadvantage they would have when using a different sense. For GMs, if a
                         player does not specify which sense they are using, assume they are perceiving with
                         all of their senses equally. A character's immediate surroundings, such as the <a href="../Part6/Chapter7.html">weather</a>
                         or their <a href="../Part6/Chapter6.html">lighting</a> may affect their 
                         ability to perceive. Some examples include searching a room, listening for the 
                         approach of enemies, or sniffing the air to see if something smells amiss. For both
                         PCs and NPCs, if a character is sneaking up on or around another, the party that is
                         not sneaking must make a Perception check contested by the sneaking party’s Stealth
                         check to determine if the sneaking party is detected or not.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Survival.</b> Survival is used primarily for tracking, hunting, and
                         surviving in the wilds. The amount of <a href="../Part6/Chapter8.html">food
                         and water found during rests</a> is determined via Survival checks. Additionally, Survival
                         can be used to harvest crafting parts and Alchemy Ingredients from creatures you slay, though
                         you add your DEX to the check instead of your WIS when using the skill in this way.
                         Examples include tracking a creature(s) through a forest, hunting for
                         game to survive, or finding food that is safe to eat.

                    <br>
                        <b>Beguilement.</b> The purpose of Beguilement checks is twofold: the first is when direct 
                         deception is called for, such as lying or attempting to disguise yourself; the second
                         is when you are performing in some way, such as via acting or performing impressive 
                         physical feats. The reason for this is because lying and performing largely requires
                         the same underlying talents, so hybridizing them into a single skill is just efficient.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Intimidation.</b> Intimidation is used whenever you wish to 
                         "coerce" another being into submitting to your will. When a creature makes an 
                         Intimidation check, the creature they are attempting to intimidate should make a 
                         Willpower save against their check to see if they resist the attempt.
                         Examples include forcing someone to follow your orders, scaring someone out of a 
                         fight, or intimidating others into avoiding you.<br>
                    <br>
                        <b>Persuasion.</b> Persuasion is used when you/your character believes diplomacy would be
                         most suited to a given situation, and wishes to use their words instead of fear or
                         violence. Examples include bartering on the price of goods, convincing a guard to
                         let you go free, or diplomatically resolving a tense situation.

            <h2>Tool Skills</h2>
            <p>Tools are an important part of not just an adventurer’s work, but any craftsman,
             artisan, or other skilled worker - after all, where would a thief be without her 
             lockpicks, or an alchemist without his mortar and pestle? <a href="./Chapter3.html">Proficiency</a>
             with Tool Skills goes up the same way proficiency with Action Skills does, via Skill
             Points. Like Action Skills, it takes 1 SP for proficiency with a Tool Skill to increase
             by 1, and all Tool Skills have a proficiency cap of 5 that can be increased to 6 through special means.</p>
            <p>Checks with Tool Skills are made similarly to Action Skill checks, in that you roll a number

             also like Action Skills, the bonus to your roll is one of your Ability Scores, however which
             it is depends on exactly what you are doing, and is up to the GM. For example, the bonus to a

            <p><b>Components.</b> Every set of tools is made up of a handful of 
             components. Someone who has <u>></u> 1 proficiency in a set of tools is familiar
             with all of its components and knows how to use them.</p>
            <p><b>Action Skills.</b> Most every set of tools directly relates to

             a specific skill pointed out in the tool’s description, then when making checks on that
             Action Skill, you may add your proficiency in the Tool Skill to your Action Skill check.
             You can add this bonus from multiple sets of tools.</p>
            <p><b>Special Use.</b> In addition to aiding with Action Skill checks, 
             many tools also have a handful of other activities they can be used for, such as brewing
             concoctions, fixing armor, or patching up an ally. Special uses for each set of tools 
             are described after the Action Skills that that set of tools gives a bonus to, though 
             there may be some others that aren’t listed. If you think of a special use, discuss it 
             with your GM.</p>
            <p><b>Sample DRs.</b> Lastly, for each set of tools, some sample DRs are
             given for various activities that can be performed using the described tools. The

                    <br>
                        Medicine Kits are a special skill, as they are the only Tool Skill that a character
                         can get better with by increasing a corresponding Action Skill: specifically,
                         proficiency in Medicine Kits is equal to a character's Medicine proficiency -1,
                         unless a character specifically spends 1 SP to make the two equal.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Components.</b> A medicine kit is comprised of a surgical needle and thread, a small
                         pair of scissors, several lengths of gauze, a collection of various sizes of small, 
                         adhesive, single-use bandages, and a sampling of pain-relieving drugs.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Action Skills.</b> Because of Med Kits' special relationship to the Medicine skill,
                         they do not also double as a bonus to that skill.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Healing.</b> A single medicine kit can be used to heal a single person over a 
                         variable period of time - from 10 minutes to an hour depending on what exactly is 
                         being done and how injured the person is. To do this, a character who is proficient
                         with Medicine Kits and has at least one in their inventory makes a check with it on
                         a creature of their choice; the creature that the kit is being used on regains an 
                         amount of Health equal to the total result of the roll. Alternatively, instead of 
                         taking the full length of time, the healing creature can use 4 actions to apply the
                         kit less effectively, healing the subject by an amount equal to half the result of
                         their check. Either way, the kit is consumed and its components are completely used
                         up. This does not work on <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automata</a>, and instead,
                         Tinkering Tools must be used.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Stabilizing.</b> If a creature is <a href="../Part6/Chapter4.html">Enduring</a>,
                         someone who is proficient with Medicine Kits and has one can attempt to stabilize 
                         them. To do this, that character can use 4 actions to make a check on the 
                         <a href="../Part6/Chapter4.html">Enduring</a> creature; this check has a DR equal to
                         the current save DR of the <a href="../Part6/Chapter4.html">Enduring</a> creature.
                         If this check succeeds, the creature is stabilized and no longer needs to make
                         saves; if the check fails, the Enduring Save DR increases by 5, to a maximum of 20;
                         if you get a Partial Success, the creature is not stabilized but neither does the 
                         save DR increase. The kit is consumed regardless of success or failure. This does
                         not work on <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automata</a>; instead, Tinkering Tools

                        Exotic weapons are unique, usually quite rare weapons that require specialized 
                         training of their own to be used effectively; for this reason, there is no “Exotic” 
                         Weapon Skill – instead, you put WP into each Exotic weapon individually. Most are 
                         foreign to the vast majority; even veteran warriors are usually not quite sure how to
                         handle one when they first encounter it. Many of them are unique to certain monk 
                         monasteries and are extremely rare or unheard of outside of them. Some Exotic weapons 
                         are made to be dual-wielded, while others cannot be without the “Two-handed 
                         Dual-Wielding” feat. Some examples of Exotic weapons included meteor hammers, 
                         nun’chaku, and chakram.

                         may deal less damage than it would if wielded with two hands. Some examples of

            <h2>Skill Checks Using Weapons</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, a character may wish to perform a task using their weapon that isn't explicitly an
             attack, but more a test of skill, like an archer trying to shoot an apple off the head of another
             creature. In these instances, rather than roll using the weapon's damage dice, instead have the
             player roll a number of d10s equal to their Weapon Skill proficiency, like you would with an
             Action or Tool Skill check, and add the appropriate Ability Score.</p>
            
            <h2>Improvised and Mechanical Weapons</h2>
            <p>Two types of weapons - improvised and mechanical - do not have corresponding skills of
             their own, and are instead explained here.</p>
            <p><b>Improvised Weapons.</b> Improvised weapons are objects that are not typically meant
             to be wielded as weapons but are used as such by the clever and creative adventurer 
             thinking on their feet. When a character decides to use an object as an improvised
             weapon, it is up to the GM to decide whether that object can be wielded as a weapon and,
             if it can, its damage, its corresponding skill (Small, Medium, Polearm, etc.) and by 
             extension your character’s proficiency with it, and other such information; most
             improvised weapons happen to fit the criteria for Small weapons, but this is not always
             the case. Some examples of improvised weapons include bottles, chairs, and sticks.</p>
            <p><b>Mechanical Weapons.</b> Mechanical weapons are special weapons that contain some sort of 
             mechanical component; some can transform into another weapon at the 
             behest of the character wielding it, while others have varying alterations that may,
             for instance, make them easier to carry or allow them to fire more frequently. The mechanics of a mech weapon
             can be figured out with a successful DR 14 Mechanics check; unless this check is passed,
             a character cannot figure out how to properly use a mech weapon unless they are shown
             how or are trained in its use.</p>
