            <center><h1>Chapter 6: Saves</h1></center>
            <p>When in times of extreme need, danger, or dire straits, a character 
             will need to make a save to escape the immediate danger. There are 3 types of saves
             in I&A: Fortitude, Reflex, and Willpower, and each is described in further
             detail below. In situations wherein more than one save may apply it is the saving 
             creatureâ€™s choice which save they use unless the cause of the save says otherwise.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that saves are mostly used to resist effects or having
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">conditions</a> placed upon the saving creature: 
             the only instances wherein saves are used to avoid damage are Fortitude saves to 
             avoid poison damage, Reflex saves to avoid traps, and Willpower saves to avoid psychic
             damage. Finally, a creature can always choose to fail a save without needing to
             roll if they so desire.</p>
            
            <h2>Making a Save</h2>
            <p>To make a save, simply roll a number of d10s equal to the appropriate save 
             score and add the higher of the two scores that make up the save; if the save is a non-whole
             value (i.e. x.25, x.5, or x.75), then you roll an additional die corresponding to the
             decimal value: for x.25, roll an additional d3; for x.5, roll an additional d6; and for x.75,
             roll an additional d8. For example, if a character with a Fortitude of 2.75 (STR 3.5 and CON 2)
             were to make a Fortitude save, they would roll 2d10 + 1d8 + 3.5.</p>
            
            <h2>Fortitude</h2>
            <p>Fortitude is determined by adding your STR and CON scores and then dividing 
             the sum by 2. Examples of when a Fortitude save would be called for are things
             like resisting the effects of poison or venom, resisting being knocked over,
             or resisting being forcibly moved.</p>
            <p>Fortitude also reduces the amount of poison damage you take: whenever you are 
             subjected to poison damage, do not reduce it by your (Ra)DEF score and instead make a 
             Fortitude save, reducing the damage you take by the result.</p>
            
            <h2>Reflex</h2>
            <p>Your Reflex score is equal to your AGI score + your DEX score and then halving that sum, 
             and is used to avoid incoming dangers that require more finesse than raw strength to evade,
             such as slipping and falling, being tripped, or dodging out of the way of an incoming 
             net.</p>
            <p>Your Reflex is also used to avoid traps. When subjected to a trap, you must make a Reflex
             save (DR determined by your GM) to avoid its damage and/or effects entirely, while on a 
             Partial Success you take half damage (reduced by your RaDEF) and/or only partially avoid
             the trap's effects - and of course, on a failure you are subjected to the full damage
             (reduced by your RaDEF) and/or effects of the trap.</p>
            
            <h2>Willpower</h2>
            <p>Willpower is ascertained by summing your CHA and either your INT or WIS and then
             dividing that sum by 2. Instances of
             Willpower saves would be resisting attempts to become possessed, keeping a 
             malevolent force out of your mind, or resisting going insane after experiencing 
             something extremely stressful or maddening.</p>
            <p>Willpower also reduces the amount of psychic damage you take: whenever you are 
             subjected to psychic damage, do not reduce it by your (Ra)DEF score and instead 
             make a Willpower save, reducing the damage you take by the result.</p>
