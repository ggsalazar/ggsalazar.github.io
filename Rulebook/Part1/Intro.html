            <h2>Iron and Aether</h2>
            <p>Throughout the 19th century, the world underwent its Second Industrial Revolution.
             Technological and industrial progress skyrocketed, and much of the world was moved 
             into a new age of science, reason, and technology. Of course, there were still those
             corners of the world that had yet to make the same progress...</p>
            <p>Though it does not take place in the real world, this is the central theme of
             Iron and Aether, or I&A for short. The idea that while the world moves forward, and
             technology and progress unceasingly advance, there are still those places that
             continue to rely on or prefer the old ways, for one reason or another. Though these
             rules do largely focus on Second Industrial Revolution-era technologies, such as
             <a href="../Part5/Chapter2.html">guns</a>, <a href="../Part5/Chapter5.html">transportation</a>, 
             <a href="../Part5/Chapter4.html">prosthetics</a>, and more, it still engages with
             magic in a handful of ways, mostly via the mystical substance referred to herein 
             as <a href="../Part7/Chapter1.html">Aether</a>. I&A explores the idea of a fantasy
             world undergoing its own Industrial Revolution, and it opens up to you the ability
             to tell stories in that space.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Important Terms</h2>
            <p>There are a handful of terms used throughout these rules that may be confusing or
             not entirely clear in their meaning if you are new to tabletop RPGs. Detailed below
             are a handful of terms that are frequently used, defined for clarity and your
             convenience.</p>
            <p><b>DR.</b> Difficulty Rating, or DR, numerically measures how hard it is for a creature
             to accomplish a specified task. In order for a check to be considered successful/passed,
             the result of the required rolls must be <u>></u> the DR of the given check.</p>
            <p><b>GM.</b> The Game Master, frequently referred to as the GM, 
             is the main rule-master and arbiter of the game world: they are in charge of 
             writing and roleplaying non-player characters, writing quests, building dungeons 
             and the worlds they inhabit, and of playing the role of essentially everything the 
             player-characters encounter during their adventures. The GM’s job is the hardest, 
             but also has the potential to be the most rewarding as they help the group weave 
             incredible stories and forge unforgettable memories.</p>
            <p><b>PC.</b> A Player-Character, or PC, is a character that is being 
             played by one of the players. They are completely under that player’s control, and 
             their class, heritage, background, skills, and more are all up to the player playing 
             them. You will find the rules and guides for all of that information in Parts 1 - 4.</p>
            <p><b>NPC.</b> Conversely, a Nonplayer-Character, or NPC, simply refers to any 
             character not being played by any of the players, but instead by the GM, who decides
             their personal information and the role they play in the story.</p>
            <p><b>ydx.</b> The letter “d” followed by a number (typically 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20)
             refers to a die with that many sides, e.g. a d6 refers to the normal 6-sided die, a 
             d20 refers to the 20-sided die, and so on. A number preceding the “d” refers to the 
             amount of that die to be rolled, so 3d4 means roll 3 of the pyramid-shaped dice and 
             add up the result of each roll; if there is no number before the “d”, then only 1 of 
             the indicated die is rolled. In the case of yd100, roll 2d10 and use one of the 
             numbers as the ten’s place and the other as the one’s place; if both come up as 10 
             (typically shown as a 0 on the die face) then that is 100. In the case of yd3, simply 
             roll y amount of d6s and divide each number (or the total result) by half, rounded up.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
            <p>As a player, it is your responsibility to be respectful of both other 
             players and your GM’s time and rulings (provided they are fair) and respect the authority 
             they have as the arbiter of the rules and constructor of the world your party is adventuring 
             in. This includes (but is not limited to) doing such things as: listening to what they say 
             to the best of your ability; not arguing with them about rulings without good reason; not 
             intruding on their or anyone else’s fun or moments to shine within the story; being honest 
             about dice rolls; and so on. Essentially, just be respectful of your GM and co-players. 
             Theirs is the hardest job at the table, and they likely spent hours crafting a fun and 
             engaging story that they thought would be enjoyable to play out with their friends. 
             Remember, even though the story (usually) revolves around the PCs, the GM is also a player, 
             and should be having just as good a time as everyone else at the table.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Running the Game</h2>
            <p>As the GM, your workload is by far the largest. You are responsible for creating
             the world the game takes place in, writing the quests your players will go on, 
             roleplaying anything and anyone the PCs come across in their adventures. You are 
             the arbiter of the rules and you have final say on any rulings that come under 
             debate by the players. It is your responsibility to craft a believable and 
             reasonably immersive world for the PCs to adventure in, to be prepared for whatever
             the players may encounter or decide to do, to treat all the players fairly and in a
             manner that is equally fun and engaging for all of them.</p>
            <p><b>Session 0.</b> When you and your prospective group all agree to start
             playing I&A, it is important that you host what is called a <b>Session 0</b>.
             This is a session that occurs prior to the official start of the adventure wherein
             you sit down with all the players and decide on various important factors,
             including but not limited to: what kind of game does everyone want to play (e.g. a
             hack-and-slash combat-filled thrill-ride of an adventure, a roleplay-heavy 
             slow-paced game of intrigue and mystery, etc.), are any of the players 
             uncomfortable with anything and/or is there any topic any of the players would like
             to avoid (e.g., "this adventure may feature elements of racism/kidnapping/child 
             violence/etc., is everyone okay with that?"), what the players want out of the game,
             and more. Always remember that everyone has the most fun when everyone is playing
             the same game – and one that they agreed to play!</p>
            <p><b>Creating Worlds and Adventures.</b> Coming up with an entire world
             and writing entire multi-session campaigns and quests can be a daunting and time-consuming
             feat. If you have decided to be the GM for your group but do not have the time or
             creative energies to do one or both of these things don't fret! Example worlds and quests,
             such as the world of Aethra and the [EXAMPLE MODULE] module provide pre-built materials
             that you can use ad hoc or simply draw inspiration from as you please.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>What is Important and What is Optional</h2>
            <p>I&A has many, many, <i>many</i> rules to keep track of. If you feel
             overwhelmed by all of it, <b>DO NOT WORRY</b>; not all of the rules need to be kept 
             track of all of the time. As the GM, it is part of your job to keep track of what is
             important to account for and what can be left by the wayside. For example, if your
             group enjoys combat and does it frequently, learning the rules for combat to the point
             that you practically have them memorized may be a good idea; or, if your
             group doesn't care about travelling or weather, the rules for those things can be 
             largely ignored until they gain relevance for one reason or another.</p>
            <p>As a baseline, most of the rules in Part 1 should be learned and understood by
             everyone playing, while many of the rules in all of the other parts likely do not
             need to be heavily pored over except for what is relevant to you and your group
             specifically.</p>
             
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>It is not difficult to see that Iron & Aether, both as a game and as a website,
             is not finished. Whole chapters are missing, there is practically no artwork, the
             Bestiary is exceedingly barren, and there are so many places where the game could
             simply be improved in one way or another. It is my plan to continue working on and
             supporting the game for the foreseeable future, adding and fixing content and 
             progressively acquiring more artwork to decorate the site. Player feedback will be
             absolutely invaluable in these efforts, so if you feel so inclined to join the 
             game's Discord, please do so! It is appreciated beyond words.</p>
            <p>I also plan to keep the game free and in digital/website format forever, as I 
             feel the many advantages to keeping it this way far outweigh the benefits of 
             publishing the game into a physical medium and selling it. However, since I enjoy
             not being homeless and not starving to death, I would kindly ask you to consider
             joining my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/griffingsalazar">Patreon</a> or 
             supporting me on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/griffingsalazar">Ko-Fi</a> so I can 
             continue doing what I love and putting all of my focus and energy into this and 
             other projects.</p>
