            <h2>Protection You Wear</h2>
            <p>Armor is an adventurer’s best friend. It grants them added protection against the
             dangers they face on their travels, from the foes and monsters they fight to the various
             traps that they encounter. Without it, no group of novices could slay a roving band of 
             Goblins, no soldier could survive an onslaught of Scorched, no outpost would have any
             hope of surviving an ork assault. Simply put, anyone who goes into combat without 
             something to keep the swords, claws, arrows, and bullets away has little-to-no chance of survival.</p>
            
            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <p>There are various types of armor in I&A, and each comes with their own benefits and drawbacks,
             as shown in the table below. Certain class features will not be usable in certain armor types,
             e.g. Aetherians cannot cast spells while wearing any armor that grants disadvantage on DEX 
             checks or any kind of shield. The weight of the armor assumes the wearer is a Medium creature.
             Light/Medium/Heavy armor takes 2/5/10 minutes to put on and take off.</p>
            <p>The type of armor you’re wearing also affects your Dodge score: none, Light, or Medium armor
             makes your Dodge score your Dodge Penalty + your AGI score + your DEX score, while Heavy armor
             makes your Dodge score your Dodge Penalty + your AGI score.</p>
            
            <h2>Armor Quality</h2>
            <p>Much like <a href="./Chapter2.html#Weapon Quality">weapons</a>, armor comes in varying degrees
             of quality, from Shoddy to Masterful, and also much like weapons, you can refer to the table below
             to see how quality affects an armor's properties, including what materials are needed to make it.</p>

            <h2>Armor Materials</h2>
            <p>In regards to what armor can be made of, there are 3 types of materials: hide, metal, and
             scale. There are 2 types of hide (beast and monster), 3 types of metal (steel, antitherium, and mithril), 
             and 2 types of scale (dragon and monster), for a grand total of 7 different armor materials. Materials can be bought or harvested, and a creature’s statistics in the 
             <a href="../../Bestiary/BestiaryHome.html">Bestiary</a> will say what kind of material, if any,
             can be harvested from it. The cost to buy the materials for <a href="../Part6/Chapter11.html">crafting</a> can be found 
             <a href="./Chapter4.html#Crafting Resources">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Traveling in Armor</h2>
            <p><a href="../Part6/Chapter8.html">Traveling</a>, especially on foot, is an exhaustive activity. For this reason, traveling in heavier armor will exhaust
             characters far faster than traveling in lighter armor. While traveling on foot in Medium/Heavy armor, a character takes fatigue damage equal to 5%/10% of their 
             maximum Health (rounded up to the nearest half) for every hour that they travel while wearing it.</p>
             
            <h2>Shields</h2>
            <p>Shields are always good whenever one feels they need some added protection.
             Shields come in a very wide variety of shapes, forms, sizes, and the like; however,
             for the sake of simplicity, all shields have been narrowed down to three categories
             based on their size, and each size confers a different bonus and has a different 
             cost, as shown in the table below. As with armor and weapons, each shield can also be
             Shoddy, Normal, Fine, Exquisite, or Masterful quality (requiring the same materials as
             given in the Armor Quality table), though the additional Armor Bonus given is only half 
             (e.g. a Fine shield gives only +1 additional Armor). Only Large shields use hide and 
             metal/scale; Small and Medium shields use only metal/scale.</p>
            <p>If you are wearing a Medium or larger shield, you cannot wield anything other than the shield in the arm wearing it and you have disadvantage on all STR and DEX checks
             involving that arm. It takes 1 second to don/doff a Small shield, 2 for a Medium shield, and 4 for a Large shield.</p>
             
            <h2>Shield Bashing</h2>
            <p>They say the best offense is a good defense, and there are those who would take
             such an axiom literally. If you wish to use your shield as a weapon, that is entirely doable, and the base damage for each shield is as follows: 1d4 for Small and
             1d6 for Medium (Large shields are too big and unwieldy to be wielded as weapons). Damage for each shield
             scales with the Weapon Skill of the same name, e.g. a character with 3 proficiency in Small weapons would deal 3d4 + their STR damage with a Small shield. All shields
             have the Short property when wielded as weapons. Finally, a <i>shoddy</i> Small shield gives an Armor Bonus of +1, not +0.</p>
