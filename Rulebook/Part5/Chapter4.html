            <h2>Necessities</h2>
            <p>Just like arms and armor, all adventurers hoping to survive more than a day or two
             in the wilds – and more than an hour in a dungeon – need their gear, from climbing rope 
             to lamps and lamp oil to weapon ammunition. Given here is a comprehensive list of all 
             the gear in I&A, as well as their cost and weight, plus descriptions for 
             abnormal or particularly useful items. Below that is a list of gear packs you may get 
             from your class, then a list of all the different sets of tools and their costs, and 
             lastly a list of crafting resources and their costs.</p>

            <p>Below is a description of all the gear listed in the table above that requires it.</p>
            <p><b>Acid Vial.</b> A vial of acid can, using 1 second, be thrown at an enemy to deal
             damage to them or poured over a mechanism such as a lock or simple machine to burn through some
             of it and possibly destroy it. When throwing it at an enemy, the acid vial can be 
             considered a Throwing weapon that deals 1d4 caustic base damage and has a 
             range/long range of 10/20m with the DEX* property.</p>
            <p><b>Ball Bearings.</b> A bag of 1000 ball bearings can be spread over a 3x3m space
             to create a mild obstacle for creatures that pass through that space;
             until the ball bearings are cleared, a creature that passes through that space must
             succeed on a DR 20 Reflex save or be knocked 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">prone</a>. If they do succeed, that area is still
             difficult terrain for them.</p>
            <p><b>Barrel.</b> A barrel is a cylindrical wooden container, bound by 
             bolted-on metal rings. It can hold up to 60 gallons of any liquid.</p>
            <p><b>Blunderbuss.</b> A blunderbuss is a special type of firearm that fires a spray of miniballs
             in a cone in front of it; it is listed here and not in <a href="./Chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a> 
             because its damage is not dependent on the user's Firearm proficiency, and instead it will 
             always deal 3d8 physical damage in a 5/10m cone in front of it (1.5 seconds required to fire it).
             A blunderbuss requires 5 miniballs, 3 oz. of gunpowder, and 2 minutes to be reloaded.
            <p><b>Bola.</b> Bolas are a type of throwing weapon consisting of two weights linked together by
             a length of durable cord, usually rope or chain, with a range of 20/60m. When you use 1.5 seconds
             to throw it at a target, they must make a Reflex save contested against your DEX check or be 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a> as the bola wraps around them. They can escape by
             either using 3 seconds to destroy the cord (assuming they have a means of doing so, i.e. a weapon) 
             or by making a STR check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes 3 seconds.</p>
            <p><b>Bucket.</b> A bucket can hold up to 2 gallons of a given liquid.</p>
            <p><b>Caltrops.</b> A score of caltrops can be used to cover a 2x2m 
             space, turning the area into difficult terrain and causing anyone who steps in the
             area to take 1 physical final damage until the caltrops are cleared.</p>
            <p><b>Camera.</b> A person using a camera can use 1.5 seconds to take a snapshot
             of anything it is pointed at, printing it out automatically at the start of the 
             user’s next turn. A camera comes with a single roll of film and can take 10 
             snapshots with each roll. It takes 3 seconds to unload a roll and another 3 to
             insert a new one.</p>
            <p><b>Canteen/Waterskin.</b> A canteen can hold ½ of a gallon of any liquid.</p>
            <p><b>Crowbar.</b> An iron rod about 50cm long, a crowbar gives one advantage
             on STR checks to pry two objects apart, or allows them to pull nails out of another
             object; it can also be used as a Small weapon (same properties as a club).</p>
            <p><b>Flamethrower.</b> A flamethrower belches flames in a 6/10m line in
             front of it, dealing 4d6 burn damage to all creatures caught therein. If a creature
             takes final damage from a flamethrower, there is an 80% chance they will be lit on 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter5.html">fire</a>.
            <p><b>Flashlight.</b> A flashlight creates a 10m cone of bright light and
             an additional 5m of dim light beyond that. It requires a free hand to use, can be 
             pointed in any direction at will, and lasts for 12 hours before the battery expires. A new 
             battery can be purchased for 2 Aeons.</p>
             <p><b>Fuel.</b> Gasoline that machines need to operate, fuel can be 
             used for a myriad of things, namely: Automata, vehicles, an Artificer’s
             Creature, a flamethrower, etc. Additionally, drenching a creature in
             half a gallon of fuel increases the burn damage they take from all 
             sources by 2d6 and makes it 100% certain that the victim will light on
             fire if exposed to flame or sparks; this will also make it nearly
             impossible to extinguish the flames and extend the duration they are 
             lit on fire by 5 minutes. 2 Aeons purchases 1 gallon of fuel.</p>
            <p><b>Grappling Hook.</b> When attached to a length of rope, a grappling hook can be
             thrown or placed onto a location to allow one to scale the rope up to that location 
             much more easily, granting advantage on Climb checks.</p>
            <p><b>Grenade.</b> A grenade is an explosive designed to be thrown (using an 1.5 seconds), with
             a range of 10/20m. It deals 2d10 + your DEX burn damage to all creatures within a 2m radius of
             where it was thrown, and goes off at the end of your next turn.
            <p><b>Gunpowder.</b> Gunpowder is a special alchemical creation that is 
             extremely flammable and volatile, allowing for the creation of explosives, bullets, cannons,
             and other weapons of the modern age. It must be handled with care, lest the user horribly 
             maim/kill themselves and/or others. Reloading a flintlock uses 1 ounce of gunpowder, while
             reloading an arquebus takes 2 (there are 16 ounces to a pound). The ingredients for gunpowder 
             are sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, and enough of these to craft a pound of it (using Alchemy 
             Supplies) can be purchased for 1 Aeon.</p>
            <p><b>Holy Symbol, Reliquary.</b> A reliquary is a container for holy symbols,
             relics, and artifacts, like a shrine.</p>
            <p><b>Hunting Trap.</b> See <a href="../Part6/Chapter13.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Lamp, Electric.</b> The electric lamp is a true wonder of invention. Using an
             electric arc, a glass-contained vacuum, and an internal filament, electric lamps 
             are able to shed bright light in a 10m radius and dim light for an additional
             10m for varying numbers of hours, depending on the materials used, which
             is usually reflected in the price of the lamp. A simple, basic electric lamp 
             usually has about 20 hours of light before the filament burns out, while a far more
             expensive one can burn for 1000 hours. Electric lamps can be switched on and off to
             extend their usefulness.</p>
            <p><b>Lamp, Oil.</b> Unlike electric lamps, the far older oil lamp burns with
             a good old-fashioned fire and uses ½ a gallon of fuel, making it reusable, unlike 
             its modern counterpart. For each ½ gallon of fuel, the lamp sheds 5m of
             bright light and 5m of dim light for 6 hours.</p>
            <p><b>Magnifying Glass.</b> Using a magnifying glass grants advantage on 
             Perception and Appraisal checks when examining a particular object.</p>
            <p><b>Manacles.</b> Manacles are used to bind one’s arms or legs together,
             severely restricting one’s movement accordingly. Each set of manacles comes with one key,
             or they can be slipped out of on a successful DR 20 Sleight of Hand check, broken with
             a successful DR 25 STR check, or picked with a successful DR 22 Thieving Tools check.</p>
            <p><b>Molotov.</b> A molotov cocktail is a thrown weapon (range 10/20m)
             that deals 3d6 burn damage to the target. If the target takes final damage, they 
             have a 75% chance of being lit on <a href="../Part6/Chapter5.html">fire</a>.
            <p><b>Net.</b> Nets function much the same way bolas do, though their appearance is quite 
             different and their range is only 2/4m. When you use 1 second to throw it at a target, they
             must make a Reflex save contested against your DEX check or be
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">restrained</a> as the net entangles them. They can escape by
             either using a 3 seconds to destroy the net (assuming they have a means of doing so, i.e. a weapon)
             or by making a STR check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes 3 seconds.</p>
            <p><b>Parachute.</b> A parachute slows a creature’s falling speed to 3m/sec,
             allowing them to land safely.</p>
            <p><b>Pickaxe.</b> A pickaxe primarily allows for one to mine ore,
             but can also be used as a Medium weapon that deals 1d6 physical base damage.</p>
            <p><b>Pitons.</b> Pitons make climbing much safer; if you drive one into a
             surface you are climbing and tie a rope around one end while it is wrapped around your 
             person, you will only fall by an amount equal to the amount of slack you put on the rope.</p>
            <p><b>Portable Ram.</b> A portable ram gives advantage on STR checks to 
             break or knock down an object. It can also be used as a Medium weapon (with the Two-Handed
             property) that deals 1d6 physical base damage.</p>
            <p><b>Quiver.</b> A standard quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p>
            <p><b>Rations.</b> Lower-class rations restore 5 Health, lower-middle, middle, and
             upper-middle-class rations restore 10, and upper-class rations restore 15.</p>
            <p><b>Silencer.</b> A silencer can be attached onto the end of a firearm to
             severely dampen the sound of up to 6 gunshots, making them audible up to only 4m.</p>
            <p><b>Shovel.</b> Primarily used for digging, a shovel can also be wielded
             as a Medium weapon (with the Two-Handed property) that deals 1d6 physical base damage.</p>
            <p><b>Sledgehammer.</b> Like mining picks and shovels, a sledgehammer can
             be used as a Medium weapon (with the Two-Handed property) that deals 1d6 physical base damage.</p>
            <p><b>Speedloader.</b> Speedloaders allow repeaters and revolvers to be fully reloaded using only 1 second.</p>
            <p><b>Spyglass.</b> A spyglass allows one to make Perception checks on targets up to 1/2km away; Perception
             checks made on targets <u>&#60;</u>500 meters away have advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Tent, Large.</b> A large tent is big enough to hold a large gathering
             of people relatively comfortably.</p>
            <p><b>Tent, Medium.</b> A medium tent can hold perhaps a dozen people 
             comfortably.</p>
            <p><b>Tent, Small.</b> A small tent can hold 2-3 people comfortably.</p>
            <p><b>Torch.</b> A torch sheds 5m of bright light and an additional 5m of
             dim light for 1 hour upon being lit. It can also be used as a Small weapon that 
             deals 1d4 physical/burn base damage.</p>
            <p><b>Whetstone.</b> A whetstone sharpens bladed weaponry, repairing burrs or blunted 
             edges, granting a +1 bonus on your first 5 attacks with the weapon after using the 
             whetstone. This bonus takes 5 minutes to apply, and a single whetstone can be used 
             indefinitely.</p>
            <p><b>Whistle.</b> A whistle emits a high-pitched shrieking sound audible 
             out to 100m for Sentients and 200m for animals.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical Prosthetics</h2>
            <p>Adventuring is a dangerous profession by its very nature, and though an adventurer
             may not always lose their life, it is not uncommon for them to lose something almost as
             precious: a limb, or an eye, or some other piece of themselves. Thankfully, thanks to
             advancements in medical science, this does not have to be the end of their life as they 
             know it, as they can replace what they lost with a mechanical alternative - provided 
             they have the funds to do so. However, this endeavor is almost always worth it, as while 
             what was lost can never truly be replaced, there are benefits to becoming part machine,
             not the least of which being the ability to return one's life to relative normalcy.</p>
            <p><b>Costly Replacement.</b> Mechanical body parts are expensive, in both time and money.
             While your GM has final say on the financial and temporal cost of each body part,
             a good starting point is for each part to cost 200 Aeons and take 15-30 days to make.</p>
            <p><b>Limbs of Steel.</b> For every two limbs replaced, increase your Armor score by 1.</p>
            <p><b>Maintenance.</b> As with all machines, mechanical body parts require regular upkeep;
             generally, oiling and cleaning the appendage once every few days with Tinkering Tools 
             (requiring <u>></u>1 proficiency) should keep it running just fine. Otherwise, it will
             rust and fall into disuse, becoming useless, though reparable; assume repairs for broken 
             body parts require half as much time and money as the cost to make the prosthetic. An
             extended period of time without maintenance will cause the machinery to break and become 
             wholly unusable, requiring either a replacement or very costly repairs (equal in cost, 
             in both time and money, as it took to create the prosthetic). For the exact DRs required
             to repair broken prosthetics, refer to the description for <a href="../Part1/Chapter2.html">Tinkering Tools</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Eletric Eyes.</b> If one or both of your eyes is replaced by machinery, you gain 
             the <b>Electric Eyes</b> trait that <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automata</a> have.</p>
            <p><b>Always Armed.</b> If one or both of your arms is replaced by machinery, you have 
             the option of having a weapon seamlessly integrated into it, allowing you to
             change between the limb’s standard form and its weapon form using 1 second, much like
             changing the forms of a mechanical weapon. However, doing so is even more costly; to have a 
             weapon implanted into your artificial limb is an additional 100 Aeons + the normal cost
             of the weapon. Additionly, you can choose for the arm to either transform fully into the         
             weapon, or for the weapon to fit inside of the arm, allowing you to take the weapon out
             and continue using both hands. If you take the latter option, that arm does not benefit
             from the <b>Limbs of Steel</b> trait.</p>
