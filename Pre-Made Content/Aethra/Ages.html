            <center><h1>The Ages</h1></center>
            <p>During the Sentients’ time on Aethra, there have been 5 Ages, characterized by their most 
             significant event(s) and briefly described below. Prior to the creation of the 
             <a href="./Calendar.html">Bahamian calendar</a> in the Age of Peace, these Ages were not
             referred to as such and history was not categorized as it is now. Ages that passed prior to 
             the creation and adoption of the Bahamian Calendar were named after their most significant
             aspects, while ages that start after its adoption will be named after whatever it was that
             brought the prior age to an end.</p>
			<p>Additionally, since the <a href="./Calendar.html">Bahamian calendar</a> was not invented 
             until the Age of Peace - 4,301 year since the Awakening of the Humanoids - each culture and
             continent utilized their own method of recording history and the major events of ages gone;
             the Humanoid races, for instance, simply recorded the number of years that had passed since
             their Awakening, i.e. what would in modern times be referred to as 503 Age of the Dragon 
             would, at the time, be referred to by Humanoids as 2479 SA (Since Awakening). Since Sal'tu and
             the more remote parts of Frigus have not yet adopted the common conventions of the rest of the
             world, they by and large still have their own methods for recording history. Those methods will
             be detailed in their respective sections <a href="./Nations.html">here</a>.</p>
             
            <h2>The Age of Awakening</h2>
            <p>The first age of recorded history, so named after the Awakening of the Humanoid races and
             their inheritance of the world from the Predecessors - or so the gods intended, as the Bestial
             and Monstrous races had already taken over large parts of Aethra. Still, this age was a
             significant one for a significant portion of Aethra's population, and so deserves its own place
             in the history books. For the Humanoids, this age was by and large filled with them coming into
             existence on the continent of Ahkos, learning of each other and the Bestial and Monstrous races,
             and taking back the contient of Ahkos from all the monsters that infested it. This age lasted
             631 years, and ended when the four Humanoid races built ships and decided to start exploring 
             the rest of the world en masse.</p>
             
            <h2>The Age of Discovery</h2>
            <p>History's second age is known as the Age of Discovery, so named after the numerous things the
             Humanoid races discovered during this time: the continents of Media, Frigus, and Sal'tu, the
             evolved Sentients, the ruins of Predecessor civilization, the seemingly-unending monsters that
             plague the world, Aether and its various forms and powers, as well as a myriad of scientific,
             technological, and alchemical advancements that were made during this time. This Age lasted
             1345 years, and concluded with the mechanical dragon Ex Machina fulfilling its promise to
             overthrow the world, ushering in the Age of the Dragon.</p>
             
            <h2>The Age of the Dragon</h2>
            <p>In the 1268th year of the Age of Discovery, a Human/Elf named Alset created a
             machine with the shape and cunning of a dragon. It was not the first of its kind, but it was the
             first that was deliberately designed to be as or more intelligent than any dragon, and as Alset
             was an absolutely brilliant engineer, he met and surpassed this goal in spades. Over the next
             several decades, the dragon, which would come to be known as Ex Machina, patiently bided its
             time, waiting for chances and opportunities to subtly and surreptitiously upgrade and improve 
             itself until it was, in a word, unstoppable. When this time came, it revealed itself to the 
             world, promising to conquer and rule Aethra for 1000 years. As thanks for creating it, Ex 
             Machina gave its creator the gift of eternal life in the form of an undying body.</p>
            <p>At first, Ex Machina fulfilled its promise of overthrowing the world and bringing everyone
             under its iron-fist rule. So it continued for a few hundred years, with the 
             machine-turned-god-king using its power to subjugate the people and crush any hope of resistance.
             After the first few centuries, however, Ex Machina realized something: it was bored. Ruling
             people – which at this point it considered little more than ants – brought it no pleasure, and
             being a tyrannical overlord was really not all it was cracked up to be. Rather, what Ex Machina
             truly desired was one thing, and one thing only: to learn, to do as it had always done and grow 
             and improve itself. Ex Machina wanted to discover the secrets of the cosmos that even the 
             Predecessors had not learned of, and for the remainder of its rule, it set out to do exactly 
             that, using every resource it – and by extension Aethra – had at its disposal. Eventually, it
             learned of the cosmos beyong Aethra's atmosphere and the Unknown Plane, and knew that these
             here-to-fore untouched realms contained the secrets and knowledge that it so desperately craved.
             So, when the 1000 years it promised came to an end, it promptly left Aethra, heading straight
             for the depths of the wider universe and eventually the Unknown Plane, ending its rule and 
             initiating the Age of Freedom.</p>
            
            <h2>The Age of Freedom</h2>
            <p>Characterized largely by Aethra being free of Ex Machina’s rule, the Age of Freedom was a time
 	 		 when many Sentients finally felt free to go out and simply live their lives as they desired, as 
			 they did before Ex Machina’s rule. Additionally, the power vacuum left by Ex Machina’s departure
			 allowed many to establish their own forms of rule, giving rise to many new governments the world
			 over - some more authoritarian than others. A few of the governments formed during this Age are 
			 still in power today, though all of those that have survived changed and evolved in one way or 
			 another. This Age lasted 976 years, and ended when the worst invasion of Scorched in recorded 
			 history abruptly began the Age of Flames.</p>
            
            <h2>The Age of Flames</h2>
            <p>In the 976th year AoR, a colossal volcano in eastern Southern Media – which would later be 
             named the Infernal Gate – erupted, killing over a million Sentients in the eruption alone. Far, far
             worse than the eruption, however, was the following invasion of Scorched, which fountained out
             of the mouth of the volcano like a geyser of murderous rage. Thus began the Age and War of 
             Flames, wherein Southern Media was, over the course of a little less than 4 centuries, taken
             over by an unending swarm of bloodthirsty demons. Though fought against vigorously by the
             combined might of the Sentients of Ahkos and Media, with no small help from whatever Dragons 
             could be convinced, this invasion of Scorched was unlike any other, and they poured unceasingly
             from the Infernal Gate no matter how many were slain. After 382 years, the Scorched were finally 
             contained to the southern half of Media, as they are unable to cross water in significant numbers
			 and the Dwarves’ Bulwark mountain range blocked their way North. Thus, the War of Flames was 
			 declared officially over, and the Age of Peace, the current age, began.</p>
            
            <h2>The Age of Peace/Current Age</h2>
            <p>Aethra's current age, the Age of Peace, began when the War of Flames was declared to be
             officially over, despite the fact that the Scorched still infest Southern Media, and are
             unlikely to leave any time soon. Even so, the threat has been stymied and contained, and does not
             appear to be getting actively worse (anymore). Thus, 153 years have passed and the world is steadily
			 beginning to feel relatively safe once more. This age has seen the creation of the Adventurers’ 
			 Guild, which created and proliferated the Common tongue, the Aeon currency, and the Bahamian 
			 calendar, all of which are now nearly-universally used everywhere except Sal’tu and certain 
			 parts of Frigus.</p>
