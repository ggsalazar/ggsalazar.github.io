            <p>Aethra is home to a wide variety of Heritages, from Humans to Elves to Drakon to Elementia 
             and more. Within this section you will find a brief description and the stats for each of
             Aethra's Heritages; these descriptions do not include cultural values or moralistic traits, as
             those vary from culture to culture and nation to nation - basically, Heritages are not monoliths,
             and each member of each Heritage is free to be their own unique person and decide their own
             opinions and beliefs about a given topic.</p>
            
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Humanoids</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Aethra is home to many Humanoid races, and they are rather unique in that each of them
                 (except for Darklings) was specifically designed by the gods to encapsulate one of the
                 Predecessors' core traits: their strength to the Dwarves, their agility went to the Elves, 
                 their intelligence to Gnomes, and their tenacity to Humans.</p>
                 
                <h2>Darklings</h2>
                <p>Even amongst the already unique Humanoids, Darklings are unique as the only Humanoid race
                 borne from evolution, as opposed to the divine creation of the other four. Darklings are the
                 result of each of the other Humanoid races populating the various cities of the Tunnels and
                 interbreeding; over the generations, the cramped confines of the Tunnels encouraged smaller
                 statures, and the various dark-visioned monsters of the Tunnels promoted the darkening of
                 the interbred Humanoids' skin, creating the dimunitive and dark-skinned Darklings that
                 populate the Tunnels today.</p>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Darklings have very dark skin, from deep blues, 
                 purples, and grays to black. Their hair is varying shades of grey, and their eyes are 
                 grey-white with no discernable pupil, though they turn dark red when using their infrared 
                 vision. Their ears are somewhat pointed.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Darklings typically live to be around 125, and reach
                 full maturity by the time they are 16.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Darklings are around 100-130cm
                 tall and weigh between 60-120 lbs. They are Small creatures.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak and write 
                 Common and Dark-Speak.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> As a Small creature, your Dodge Penalty is -2.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Your RaDEF is your DEF + 4.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Being Small, your base Speed is 2.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Being Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <p>Darklings are small humanoids that have adjusted to years of living underground,
                 and the following are several Heritage features that fit that theme. Select 4
                 features from this or any other Heritage feature list.</p>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your DEX by .5, up to 5. This feature
                 can be taken twice.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter6.html">Infrared Sight</a>.</b> Darklings have the
                 ability to see in the dark via infrared vision; your pupils, typically imperceptible,
                 become red when you do.<br>
                <b>Keen Ears and Natural Stealth (Extra Skills).</b> Having learned to rely on both their
                 eyes and ears to survive, Darklings’ sense of hearing is a bit more enhanced than most, 
                 increasing your Perception proficiency by 1, up to 5; additionally, Darklings’ dark flesh 
                 allows them to blend in easily with darkness, increasing your Stealth proficiency by 1, up 
                 to 5.<br>
                <b>Adaptability (Poison).</b> You gain advantage on saves against poisons and diseases.<br>
                
                <br>
                
                <h2>Dwarves</h2>
                <p>One of the four defining traits of the Predecessors was their incredible physique; 
                 unbridled physical strength and toughness that allowed them to regularly perform 
                 borderline superhuman feats and survive what a typical Human would consider a mortal
                 wound. When designing the new generation of Sentient races, the gods chose to take this
                 incredible physical prowess and embody it in the Dwarves. As a result of this, Dwarves
                 typically value physical strength above all else, and Dwarven cultures usually tend toward
                 "might makes right" or some variation thereof. Dwarves on Aethra typically make their homes
                 in and on Aethra's various mountains, as mountains are seen as symbols of great physical
                 strength, and working the stone gives Dwarves ample opportunity to show off and enhance their
                 incredible fortitude.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Dwarf skin is thicker and tougher than other races’, and greys as they
                 get older. They don’t grow any hair on top of their head, but do tend to grow thick and
                 mangy beards of various colors - typically black, brown, red, yellow, or grey - with the
                 males’ typically growing longer than the females’. Aside from that, male and female Dwarves
                 are virtually physically indistinguishable, even to other Dwarves.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Dwarves live a rather long while, about 250 
                 years, and reach full maturity by their 50th year.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Dwarves are a bit small but 
                 quite stocky, usually hovering around 120cm tall and 150 – 200 pounds. They 
                 are Small.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak and write
                 Common and Dwarvish.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Due to being Small, you have a Dodge Penalty of -2.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Your Small stature grants you a RaDEF of your DEF + 4.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> As Small creatures, Dwarves have a base Speed of 2.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Even though Dwarves are Small, their natural
                 stockiness negates the typical STR loss/DEX gain.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Dwarves are short and stocky humanoids, and the following are several Heritage 
                 features that fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage
                 feature list.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your STR or CON by .5, up to 5. This
                 feature can be taken twice.<br>
                <b>Adaptability (Poison).</b> You gain advantage on saves against poisons and diseases.<br>
                <b>Monstrous Fortitude.</b> Your <a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> 
                 score increases by 1.<br>
                <b>Thick Skin.</b> Dwarves have developed a tough and hardy exterior, making your
                 base Armor score 2.<br>
                 
                <br>
                
                <h2>Elves</h2>
                <p>In addition to their raw physical power, the Predecessors were extremely agile, lithe,
                 and graceful. This finesse was granted to the Elves, whose slender bodies and highly
                 adaptable genes showcase the tangible beauty and grace of the Predecessors. As a result of
                 this, not only are Elves typically more dextrous and agile than the other races, but they
                 are also highly genetically adaptable, able to evolve to exist comfortably in a new environment
                 within just 2 or 3 generations; however, the trade-off for this is their incredibly short lifespans,
                 with the oldest Elves barely making it to 65.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Though all Elves do generally retain their tall height and 
                 lithe forms, each subrace has its own unique physical features, described in the
                 subrace description.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> An Elf's candle burns bright but short, typically
                 averaging around 50, sometimes reaching 60 years, and they reach maturity 
                 around 7 years old.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Elves are tall, with the 
                 shortest approaching but not going beneath 180cm and the tallest going up
                 to 2 meters; they typically weigh about 170-250 pounds and are Big creatures.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak and write
                 Common and Elvish.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Since they are Big, Elves have a Dodge Penalty of -4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Being Big, your RaDEF score is your DEF + 2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Your base Speed is 3.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Being Big, you gain .5 to your STR and
                 lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Elves are tall and lithe humanoids, and the following are several Heritage 
                 features that fit that theme.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your AGI or DEX score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Subraces.</b> There are 8 subraces of Elves: city, dark, forest, frost, 
                 mountain, plains, sand, and water. Pick one for your character.
                
                <h3>City Elves</h3>
                City Elves are those who have taken to urban and city living, abandoning nature
                 for a more technologically-inclined life. City Elves typically value hard work
                 and living for oneself, rather than devoting their livelihood to the betterment
                 of their community like most other Elves. They are also the most diverse of all
                 the Elves in terms of philosophical outlook, morality, appearance, skillsets, 
                 and tastes.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> The physical appearance of a City Elf is extremely variable,
                 with very few commonalities between any given two. There is no typical skin, 
                 hair, or eye color, and it is not uncommon to see a City Elf with a bit of
                 webbing between their fingers or a distinct streak of leafy green hair.<br>
                <b>Apprenticed and Practiced (Extra Skills).</b> Your city life has given you practice with
                 a single set of tools, granting you 1 proficiency in a single Tool Skill of your choice;
                 additionally, your life among urban folk grants you 1 proficiency in any one Action Skill of
                 your choice.<br>
                <b>Dumb Luck.</b> Once between night’s rests, you can choose to grant yourself 
                 advantage on any attack, check, or save.<br>
                <b>Multi-Lingual.</b> Your proximity to the many other peoples of the world means
                 that you have learned to speak and write one extra <a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">language</a>
                 of your choice.
                
                <h3>Dark Elves</h3>
                Dark Elves are those who have learned to survive for a few generations in dark 
                 and dank places, typically deep cave and mining systems or other underground 
                 environs. This has granted them infrared sight and darker appearances than most
                 other races, second only to Darklings.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Dark Elves, as the name would imply, are quite dark in 
                 appearance, with their skin tones ranging from dark blue to purple to gray to
                 black. Their hair and eyes follow much the same pattern, except that their eyes
                 can also be red.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter6.html">Infrared Sight</a>.</b> Dark Elves can see 
                 in the infrared spectrum, allowing them to see in the dark more or less just as
                 easily as in the light; when using their thermal vision, their eye color changes
                 to red.<br>
                <b>Keen Ears and Natural Stealth (Extra Skills).</b> Dark Elves have learned to rely on their
                 ears just as well as their eyes, increasing their Perception proficiency by 1; additionally,
                 your darker skin allows you to more easily blend into the darkness, increasing your Stealth
                 proficiency by 1<br>
                <b>Multi-Lingual.</b> In addition to Common and Elvish, you can also speak and
                 write Dark-Speak.
                
                <h3>Forest Elves</h3>
                Forest Elves have become accustomed to living in wooded, forested, and jungled
                 areas.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Forest Elves generally have light green skin, their hair 
                 varies from green to brown to red to brown, and their eyes vary from brown to
                 green to occasionally blue. They are lean and agile, even for Elves.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Your time navigating the woodlands makes you
                 faster on your feet, increasing your AGI score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Nature Affinity (Extra Skills).</b> Your time within nature increases your 
                 proficiency in the Beast Handling and Nature skills by 1, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Adaptability (Poison).</b> Forest Elves have built up a resistance to dangerous
                 toxins in their environment, granting you resistance to poison damage and 
                 advantage on saves against poisons and diseases.
                
                <h3>Frost Elves</h3>
                Frost Elves are Elves that have acclimated to cold and snowy environments.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> You have pale white skin with slight blue undertones, white to
                 blue hair, and eyes that vary from white to blue to green. Frost Elves also tend
                 to be a bit huskier and hairier than other races, given that they live in colder
                 environs.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your CON score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Cold Acclimated (Adaptability).</b> You are resistant to freeze damage.<br>
                <b>Thick Skin.</b> Your body's natural resistance to the cold also protects you
                 a bit from other dangers, increasing your base Armor score to 2.
                
                <h3>Mountain Elves</h3>
                The Elves of the mountains are strong and hardy, more akin to dwarves than any other race.
                 As their name would imply, they have built their homes in the mountains and tall hills of the 
                 world. They are slightly more stout than the rest of the Elves, but they are also more sturdy 
                 and have stronger lungs (as well as being more stubborn).<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> The skin, hair, and eyes of Mountain Elves are all various
                 shades of grey and brown.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Your STR or CON score increases by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Climber (Extra Skills).</b> You gain 2 proficiency in the Climb skill, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Monstrous Fortitude.</b> Your Fortitude score increases by 1.
                
                <h3>Plains Elves</h3>
                Elves who live in the plains and grasslands of the world are Plains Elves.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Elves of the plains tend to be slightly tan and have dark eyes
                 and hair. Like Forest Elves, they are lean.<br>

                <h3>Sand Elves</h3>
                Sand Elves are those that have grown accustomed to hot and arid climates, 
                 typically living in or near deserts. Many Sand Elves – though not all – are 
                 nomadic, constantly wandering through or across the deserts they call home, 
                 sometimes building cities, though this is a rare occasion.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Sand Elves have very dark characteristics, with dark skin, hair, 
                 and eyes.<br>

                <h3>Water Elves</h3>
                Having built their lives and communities in the more aquatic climes of the world, Water Elves
                 have made their homes in wetlands, swamps, and shallow waters. They have very strong lungs and 
                 are natural swimmers.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Water Elves are light blue to sea-green in skin, hair, and 
                 eye tone, and scales or webbed appendages are not uncommon.<br>
                <b>Adaptability (Freeze).</b> You are resistant to freeze damage.<br>
                <b>Fins and Gills.</b> Your Swim proficiency increases by 1, and can be increased

                <h2>Gnomes</h2>
                <p>The Predecessors were not just physically superior, but intellectually as well, and it was the
                 Gnomes that inherited their brilliant minds. Opposite to Dwarves in nearly every way except height,
                 Gnomes are lanky and wirey, and where the Dwarves put stock in strength and physical power, Gnomes
                 value intelligence and pursuits of the mind above perfection of the body. Many of Aethra's most famed
                 scholars, philosophers, and inventors are Gnomes, as well as a not-insignificant number of their
                 artists and creatives as well.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Like Dwarves, Gnomes are of a short stature, though unlike Dwarves,
                 Gnomes are rather lanky and thin. Male Gnomes do not grow hair on the top of their head, 
                 though they do on the sides and back, with small facial growths not being uncommon either.
                 Female Gnomes, on the other hand, only grow hair on the top of their head (not counting
                 their eyebrows), and it typically does not grow very long. In terms of skin, hair, and eye
                 color, Gnomes are as varied as Humans.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Gnomes live for a good long while, lasting up to 150 years of age.
                 They reach maturity at around 30 years old.<br>

                <h2>Humans</h2>
                <p>Finally, we have Humans, the most emblematic of the Humanoid races. In addition to their
                 strength, dexterity, and intellect, the Predecessors had one quality which allowed them to
                 wage war against the gods themselves for more than 3 millenia: their incredible tenacity, and
                 it was this that was given to the Humans, arguably making them the most strong-willed of the
                 Humanoids, and unquestionably the most persistent. It is due to this tenacity that Humans
                 are, above all, known for never, ever, giving up, even in the face of what any other race 
                 would consider insurmountable odds, and it is due to this more than anything that Humans
                 have successfully carved their own path across the annals of Aethra's history books. Humans
                 have been incredible scholars, leaders, creators, warriors, trailblazers - you name it,
                 Humans have done it and almost always held their own at it, particularly at times when others
                 would - or did - give up.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Humans have quite varied appearances, with skin color that
                 can be any shade of white, brown, or black, hair that can be similar tones (or even
                 yellow-red), and eye colors across the color spectrum, from deep black to vibrant green.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Humans have a decently long lifespan, reaching 
                 about 100 years. They reach maturity at around 20 years old.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Humans vary from 150 - 200cm
                 and about 100 – 240 pounds. They are usually Medium (150-180cm) but can be Big (181-200cm).<br>

                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>

            <div class="content">
                <p>On Aethra, the Monstrous races are those that evolved from the various monsters of
                 the world - creatures that were explicitly designed to hunt and kill sentient life.
                 However, some of those creatures evolved and changed over time to the point where,
                 in an ironic twist of fate, they themselves became sentient, forming the Monstrous
                 races.</p>
                <h2>Drakon</h2>
                <p>Drakon share an ancestor with modern-day Kobolds; where some of those ancestors chose to
                 continue inhabiting various caves, tunnels, and other subterranean systems (creating
                 modern-day Kobolds), some of those ancestors chose to leave their dark and dank homes
                 and inhabit the various wilds and wastes of the world, in so doing becoming bigger and
                 phsyically stronger. These creatures evolved and became the Drakon, scale-covered bipeds
                 that in many ways resemble humanoid Dragons. Today's Drakon are incredibly varied and very
                 well-adapted to survive in the harsh wilds of the world. With scales, talons, breath weapons,
                 and more, Drakon make for an extremely intimidating sight and an outright terrifying foe.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Drakon are covered head-to-toe in scales and have sharp teeth,
                 claws, and prehensile tails. Horns of various lengths and styles decorate their heads,
                 upper backs, and joints. Male Drakon typically have larger and more pronounced horns 
                 than females. Their eye colors are usually green, red, yellow, or blue.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Drakon usually live to be about 80. They reach
                 maturity at around 15.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Drakon vary from about 180 - 210cm tall and

                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> Since you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and

                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Drakon are dragon-like, and the following are several Heritage features that
                 fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage feature list.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Increase your STR or CON by .5, up to 5. This feature can be
                 taken twice.<br>
                <b>Breath Weapon.</b> Select one damage type that is not fatigue, physical, or true; once
                 between night's rests, you can take 3 seconds to expel a damaging burst of energy of that
                 damage type out of your mouth. This burst can take the form of either a 5-meter cone or a
                 10-meter line, deals 1d8 + your CON score base damage, and scales with your chosen Weapons
                 Proficiency.<br>
                <b>Claws and Fangs.</b> Drakon have sharp claws, which count as Unarmed weapons 
                 and deal 1d4 physical base damage.<br>
                <b>Scales.</b> Drakon are covered in scales that increases their base Armor score
                 to 2.<br>
                <b>Tail.</b> You have a prehensile tail, which is flexible, long, and strong
                 enough to essentially function as a 3rd arm.<br>
                <b>Wings.</b> You have a pair of leathery wings that grant you a flying speed; 
                 this flying speed is determined by your Size and STR score in the same manner 
                 your walking speed is determined by your Size and AGI score.<br>
                
                <br>
                
                <h2>Goblins</h2>
                <p>Goblins share an ancestor with modern-day Orks; where modern Orks evolved to become stronger
                 and dumber than their Predecessor-hunting ancestors, the ancestors of Goblins split and focused
                 their efforts on becoming quick and crafty - by Ork standards, at least. As a result, the Goblins
                 of today are thin and wiry, some might even say gangly, far removed from their Ork cousins, and
                 have evolved a great enough amount of intelligence to be considered fully sentient. Despite their
                 origins, Goblins are no more or less malicious than any of the other Sentients.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Goblins are generally thin and lanky creatures, with black or
                 dark grey hair and similar eyes. Their limbs have the appearance of being just a bit too
                 long for their lean torsos, and their skin varies between shades of dull grey, green, 
                 red, yellow, and blue, with the individual Goblins of one tribe or clan generally being
                 varying shades of one hue.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Goblins live short lives, maturing at 10 years old
                 and living to around 70.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Goblin height varies by about a foot, from
                 as short as 120cm to as tall as 150cm, and they weigh anywhere between 60 to 140 pounds.
                 They can be Small (120-130cm) or Medium (131-150cm).<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You speak Common and Monstrine.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> A Goblin’s base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Goblins are small and lanky, making them hard to hit; if you are
                Small, your Dodge Penalty is -2 and if you are Medium, your Dodge Penalty is -3.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> If you are Small/Medium, your RaDEF is your DEF + 3/2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Being Small/Medium makes your base Speed 2.5/3m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                Goblins are slippery little creatures, and the following are several Heritage
                 features that fit that theme. Select 4 features from this or any other Heritage
                 feature list.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Improvement.</b> Improve your DEX or AGI by .5, up to 5.

                 granting you resistance to one damage type that is not fatigue, physical, or 
                 true. If you select poison, you do not gain resistance but instead gain advantage on saves 
                 against poisons and diseases.<br>
                <b>Animal Reflexes.</b> Your animalistic instinct for danger improves your Reflex
                 score by 1.<br>

                <h2>Kobolds</h2>
                <p>Sharing an ancestor with the Drakon, Kobolds come from a race of lizard-like creatures
                 that were explicitly created to be slaves and servants to Dragons as a reward and thanks
                 from the gods for their aid in fighting the Predecessors during the War for Dominance. Once
                 the war was over and with many of the Dragons either slain or returned to their home plain,
                 many of the ancestors of Kobolds chose to stay their cave and tunnel homes, evolving to
                 eventually become the Kobolds of today. Though their innate Dragon loyalty has largely
                 been removed, there are still some Kobolds today who do have a tendency to look favorably
                 upon the opportunity to help a Dragon when the opportunity presents itself.</p>
                 <br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Kobolds are covered head-to-toe in scales of any one or two colors,
                 usually the same as the environment their clan has survived in for several
                 generations. Kobolds also have horns on their heads or spines running down their 
                 backs, though the lengths and styles of these vary from clan to clan and Kobold to 
                 Kobold. Their eye color is extremely varied. Female Kobolds have no perceptible 
                 breast tissue, longer snouts than males, and shorter horns/spines.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Kobolds live to around 60 and mature by the time they
                 are 8.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Kobolds are short and 
                 slender, being 100-130cm tall and usually weighing about 75-120
                 pounds; their size is Small.<br>

                <p>Much like the Monstrous Heritages, the Bestial Heritages of Aethra were not divinely
                 created but instead were born out of millenia of evolution; however, unlike the Monstroids,
                 the Bestials share ancestors with the world's various Beasts and animals, those creatures
                 that simply inhabit the world alongside sentient life and do not exist solely to end it. For
                 much of Aethra's history, the Bestial races have largely been confined to the continent of
                 Sal'tu, which as of the 153rd year of the Age of Peace is home to 4 different empires; these
                 dynasties are described <a href="./Nations.html">here</a>. Though most Bestials reside there,
                 travellers and emigrants are not uncommon, and as a result most people in the civilized world
                 have met or at least seen a handful of Bestial Sentients.</p>
                <h2>Canidae</h2>
                <p>Evolved from canines long past, Canidae share a common ancestor with dogs, wolves, and the other
                 various canines of the world, giving them enhanced senses of hearing and smell, as well as

                 atop their heads and elongated snouts. This fur can be mostly any color, though the most common
                 are shades of grey, brown, and yellow. They do have tails, though they are not long or strong enough
                 to function as an extra limb, instead typically belying the Canidae's mood. They resemble humanoid
                 canines.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Canidae, like Elves, are rather short-lived, usually living to see 50. They

                <p>Corvium share an ancestor with modern-day corvids, widely regarded to be the most intelligent of
                 the bird archetypes - and given that some of them evolved into sentience, it is not hard to see why.
                 In addition to their sharp eyes and winged bodies, Corvium are also able to mimic the sounds that they
                 have heard quite flawlessly, a useful mechanism for not just survival, but stealth and clandestine work
                 as well. Most Corvium can be found in [EMPIRE NAME].</p>

                <h2>Felinae</h2>
                <p>Much like how Canidae came from the ancestors of dogs, Felinae share an ancestor with today's
                 cats, lions, and other felines. Proud and self-important, many Felinae have a tendency to view
                 themselves as being above others, often answering only to their own authority if they answer to 
                 one at all. Though this does, in some instances, make them annoying or outright difficult to work
                 with, many others know that it is easiest to simply play along with the Felinae's little game, and
                 placate their ego so long as it means the Felinae's cooperation. Most of today's Felinae reside
                 in the [EMPIRE NAME].</p>

                 can be any color or pattern, though a Felinae offspring will usually have 
                 a similar coloring and pattern to one or both of their parents. Felinae do
                 have tails, but they are usually not strong enough to function as an extra limb.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Felinae live decently long lives, averaging around 100
                 years and reaching maturity at around 20.<br>

                 the snakes and serpents of the world. Many Ophiri are looked upon with distrust for
                 their appearance and Heritage, and though there are those who embrace this reputation,
                 using their talents for clandestine and irreputable work, Ophiri are no more naturally
                 inclined to evil than any other thinking and feeling race of people on Aethra.</p>

                 hairless, with eyes ranging from yellow to dark green to brown to black. Lastly, female
                 Ophiri tend to have sharper and more pronounced facial features, with no perceptible

                <p>Last but not least we have the special Heritages, those that are unique in that they
                 are either exceptionally rare or have special features that are exclusively seen amongst
                 their own kind, such as the mechanical Automata or the half-Undead Dhampir. As their name
                 would imply, everything about the special Heritages is unusual, as they are not bound to
                 the rules that the other races must abide by. How common they are, where they come from,
                 how many people know of/about them, all of this and more vary from special race to special
                 race. The Dhampir, for example, are thought of as nothing more than myth and legend in many
                 parts of the world, with few in all of Aethra's history that have ever actually met one;
                 Automata, on the other hand, are numerous throughout the continents of Ahkos and Northern
                 Media, but are sparse on Frigus and extremely rare on Sal'tu, both because of that continent's
                 disconnect from the rest of the world and because the conditions there are unfavorable for 
                 mechanical life. Elementia, on the other hand, are known of everywhere, but due to their strange
                 features, relative rarity, and inborn power are still treated as figures of legend, or even
                 divine descent in some cultures.</p>
                 
                <h2>Automata</h2>
                <p><b>Wire and Metal.</b> Automata (singular Automaton) are not born but created, literally built using wiring, machine parts, 
                 and Life Aether – and it is this last ingredient that sets them apart from other 
                 machines, as that is what gives them their sentience. When an Automaton is first built,
                 it begins its life unthinking and unfeeling, like any other construct. However, as time
                 wears on, it Awakens, becoming aware of itself as it starts to feel and decide what to 
                 do of its own accord. Once they have Awakened, Automata are mentally and emotionally 
                 indistinguishable from other Sentients.</p>
                 
                <p><b>Maintenance</b> Because Automata are constructs, they do require some daily maintenance. Once a 
                 day, an Automaton must ingest a gallon of fuel to keep themselves running, though they 
                 can go about 4 days without it before their systems start to shut down – an analogy
                 to the naturally-occurring hunger of other races would be appropriate.<br>
                In addition, once every day, Automata must enter a 3-hour hibernation 
                 period, wherein most of their systems shut down, their working memory clears, and their 
                 storage is re-organized. This resting period can be voluntarily held off, though an 
                 Automaton’s systems will slowly deteriorate as time without it goes on; again, an analogy
                 to a need for sleep would be fitting.<br>
                Lastly, while Automata are made of metal and cannot technically drown, 
                 being submerged can be dangerous for them as the fluid may damage their fuel cells or clog 
                 and slow down their machinery or other systems (being washed, however, is safe). A submerged
                 Automaton has a number of minutes equal to their CON modifier before their systems shut
                 down and they die (minimum 30 seconds). However, since they do not have respiratory 
                 systems, Automata do not have to worry about breathing in dangerous vapors.</p>
                 
                <p><b>Automata Name Examples</b> Automata are typically named after the sounds their bodies make, a prominent piece of 
                 their body, or the role they were made to fulfill. Some Automata decide to take up an entirely
                 new name for themselves upon Awakening, but this is not necessarily always the case. Automata 
                 are asexual, so there is no differentiation between male or female names.<br>
                <b>Names.</b> Bang, Battery, Brasshead, Clank, Creak, Friend, Gasket, Gear, 
                 Golem, Number 23, Piston, Protector, Soldier, Steam, Whistle.</p>
                
                <h3>Traits</h3>
                <b>Varied Appearance.</b> The specifics of Automata appearance and size can vary greatly, 
                 as they can be made in pretty much any image. However, some commonalities exist; all Automata are
                 made of some sort of strong metal, usually steel. Some mithril Automata exist, though these are 
                 exceedingly rare.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> With proper long-term maintenance, Automata can theoretically 
                 live forever. This maintenance includes oiling, fixing damages, getting rid of rust, replacing old 
                 parts, etc. Without it, they have a life expectancy of about 40 years as their parts wear down and 
                 gradually fall into disuse. Automata reach full maturity within a few years of being Awakened.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Automata vary in height from 
                 1-2 meters. They can be Small (100-130cm), Medium (131-180cm), or Big (181-210cm).<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak 
                 and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br>
                <b>Tough Chassis.</b> Automata have a base Armor score of 3.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If your Automaton is Small/Medium/Big, you have a Dodge Penalty of
                 -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> If your Automaton is Small/Medium/Big, your RaDEF is your DEF +
                 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Being Small/Medium/Big makes your base Speed 2.5/3/3.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Electric Eyes.</b> Your mechanical eyes can double as flashlights, which you can take
                 1 second to turn on. While this effect is active, you have disadvantage on
                 Stealth checks. If the effect is inactive, you no longer have disadvantage on Stealth 
                 checks, however you cannot see in the dark.<br>
                <b>Machine Learning.</b> Automata’s logical and mechanical minds grants them an
                 advanced intelligence, increasing your INT score by .5, up to 5.<br>
                <b>Made of Metal.</b> You are vulnerable to caustic and electric damage and resistant to
                 burn damage.<br>
                <b>No Lungs.</b> Because you do not breathe, you are unaffected by dangerous vapors such
                 as poisonous gas; however, you can still drown (see “Maintenance” above).<br>
                
                <h3>Variant Automata: Four-Armed</h3>
                Some Automata are engineered with 2 extra arms built into their chassis, allowing for greater physical
                 strength and, in many, increased manual dexterity. These Automata are referred to as the Four-Armed. What the
                 Four-Armed gain in physical prowess, however, they lose in mental capability, as their extra brainpower is 
                 concentrated on keeping all of their limbs working in tandem. Use the following stats if you wish to play a 
                 Four-Armed.<br>
                <b>Varied Appearance.</b> Four-Armed are much the same appearance-wise as their bimanual counterparts.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Four-Armed are much more mechanically complex than 
                 normal Automata, and so require more regular and careful upkeep. Without it, they can go only 
                 about 30 years before they break down completely and die.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Like 
                 regular Automata, Four-Armed can be Small (100-130cm), Medium (131-180cm), or Big (181-210cm).<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You 
                 can speak, understand, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br>
                <b>Tough Chassis.</b> Four-Armed also have a base Armor score of 2.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> Small/Medium/Big Four-Armed have a Dodge Penalty of -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> Small/Medium/Big Four-Armed have a RaDEF of their DEF + 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> Being Small/Medium/Big makes your base Speed 2.5/3/3.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Electric Eyes.</b> Four-Armed eyes also double as flashlights in much
                 the same way as the Automatas' do, granting you the benefits of the <b>Electric Eyes</b> trait, 
                 described above.<br>
                <b>Made of Metal.</b> You are vulnerable to caustic and electric damage and resistant to
                 burn damage.<br>
                <b>No Lungs.</b> Because you do not breathe, you are unaffected by dangerous 
                 vapors such as poisonous gas; however, you can still drown (see “Maintenance” above).<br>
                <b>Quadridextrous.</b> You have 4 arms instead of 2. Your extra arms can be 
                 stored inside your chassis until you use them, making you appear as a normal 
                 Automaton until they come out.
                
                <br>
                
                <h2>Dhampir</h2>
                <p><b>Spawn of Life and Undeath.</b> Dhampir are born from the union between a Sentient and a Major Vampire Spawn. 
                 As such, they are neither Undead nor alive, and spells that affect Undead usually do 
                 so at a much lesser degree for them than they would a full Undead. Like their Vampire 
                 Spawn parent, they tend to be pale, like a corpse.<br>
                Dhampir bodies do age and they are fully sentient, but that hasn’t 
                 stopped many from believing that they are just as monstrous as their Undead parent; 
                 because of this, Dhampir typically face extreme prejudice, sometimes warranted and 
                 sometimes not. If they are careful, they are able to live decently 
                 normal lives.</p>
                 
                <p><b>A Life on the Move.</b> Many Dhampir often have trouble finding reliable, stable sources of food; though 
                 they are able to steal blood in the night from hapless victims in whatever town they 
                 happen to be staying in, most take up a life on the road, sometimes alone, but more 
                 frequently in groups comprised of trusted allies. This constant migration usually leads
                 to a life of adventuring, though not always. Some Dhampir simply choose to live out 
                 their lives with their Vampire Spawn parent, and for them life is much simpler, if 
                 darker.</p>
                
                <h3>Traits</h3>
                <b>Appearance.</b> Individual Dhampir vary wildly in appearance, following the trends
                 of their parents’ races. They are more pale than normal, however.<br>
                <b>Age.</b> Dhampir have a natural lifespan of about 500 years, and reach 
                 maturity at the same rate as their physical heritage.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> Your size is based entirely on the
                 sizes of both your parents.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter9.html">Languages</a>.</b> You can speak, 
                 read, and write Common and Mortuan.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score, like your size, depends entirely on your
                 Heritage. If neither of your parents would give you an Armor bonus, your base
                 Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your Dodge Penalty is -2/-3/-4.<br>
                <b>RaDEF.</b> As a Small/Medium/Big creature, your RaDEF is your DEF + 4/3/2.<br>
                <b>Speed.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your base Movement is 2.5/3/3.5m/sec.<br>
                <b>Ability Score Adjustments.</b> If you are Small, you gain .5 to your DEX and
                 lose .5 in STR; if you are Big, you gain .5 to your STR and lose .5 in DEX.<br>
                <h4>Heritage Features</h4>
                <b>Infrared Vision.</b> You can see in the infrared spectrum; your eyes become 
                 red when you do.<br>
                <b>Semi-Vampyric Physique.</b> Your STR and AGI scores both increase by .5, up 
                 to 5.<br>
                <b>Partial Undead Nature.</b> You have advantage on saves against poisons & diseases 
                 and being put to sleep against your will, and you only need to sleep for 3 hours.<br>
                <b>Bloodthirst.</b> Dhampir require the blood of living Sentients to stay 
                 alive, in addition to half as much normal food as a normal Sentient would eat. 1 quart
                 of Sentient blood must be consumed every 15 days, and it can be taken willingly or 
                 otherwise (see the “Bloodfeast” feature below). If enough blood is not consumed, your
                 maximum Health is temporarily reduced by 25% every two weeks until you either die or
                 consume blood, at which point your maximum Health is restored by 25%.<br>
                <b>Bloodfeast.</b> Once between night’s rests, you can take 2 seconds
                to make an Unarmed attack (1d4 physical base damage, DEX property) against one target 
                that is a Sentient. If you deal final damage, the target is <a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                by you, and you can then choose to spend another 2 seconds drinking the target’s blood,
                quenching your Bloodthirst and healing you for half the final damage dealt (rounded up);
                however, doing so will also cause you to be <a href="../../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                until the start of your next turn. If the target is diseased or poisoned, you must pass
                a <a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save with a DR equal 
                to the original poison or disease, otherwise you now suffer from the same affliction. If
                the victim is willing, do not subtract their DEF score from your attack roll.<br>
                
                <br>
                
                <h2>Elementia</h2>
                <p><b>Children of the Elements</b> A Sentient with <a href="../../Rulebook/Part7/Chapter1.html">Aether</a> fused into
                 their very being, an Elementia is an incredibly special creature. They are the child
                 of two Sentients with the essence of a single element ingrained into their very DNA, 
                 altering their appearance accordingly and giving them incredible extranatural powers unlike
                 those wielded by any other breed of Sentients.<br>
                There are three circumstances that create such a being: the first is when 
                 a child is born on one of the <a href="../../Rulebook/Part7/Chapter5.html">Elemental Planes</a>
                 – though this may create an <a href="../../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>,
                 there is an equal chance (1 in 3) that the child will instead become an 
                 Elementia; one other way is when one or two especially powerful (Level 11 or 
                 higher) <a href="../../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> have a child – if it 
                 is just one such <a href="../../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>, there is a 
                 25% chance the child will be an Elementia of the sorcerer’s element, and if two                 
                 <a href="../../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians</a> have a child together, there
                 is a 50% chance that the child will be an Elementia of 1 of the parents’ 
                 elements; the last way is if two Elementia decide to have a child, then the 
                 child will be a full Elementia of one of the two types.<br>
                Elementia are… anomalies, to put it lightly. Light-Fire Elementia may be mistaken for 
                 demons, Space-Air Elementia could be regarded as angels, Dark-Void Elementia mistaken for 
                 Dark Elves, etc. Because of this, many Elementia shun social interaction, some
                 going to great lengths to hide their extranatural features, or going into 
                 self-imposed exile and living as outcasts. Other Elementia take this special 
                 treatment and use it to their advantage, tricking the less intelligent into
                 worshipping them as gods or demigods, or using their visage and inherent power
                 to work their way into positions of authority.</p>
                 
                <h3>Traits</h3>
                There are, technically, 6 subraces of Elementia – and two subtypes for each subrace –
                 however, the majority of their traits are similar enough to only be described 
                 once, and it is up to you to fill in the blanks and use the traits given as a 
                 skeletal framework to create your Elementia.<br>
                <b>Elemental.</b> Every Elementia has the essence of one of the 6 elements – Dark, Light,
                 Magic, Soul, Space, or Time – infused into their very being due to the extranatural/arcane 
                 circumstances of their birth. Pick one of the elements for your character, and use that as 
                 the main guideline around which your Elementia’s traits are based.<br>
                <b>Appearance.</b> An Elementia’s appearance is dependent on which element they are bonded 
                 to. Briefly described here is a vague guideline for each element:<br>
                <i>Dark-Frost</i> - Pale blue/white skin, hair, and eyes. Is slightly cold to the touch.<br>
                <i>Dark-Void</i> - Dark skin, sometimes dark hair. Eyes typically have the 
                 appearance of pupil-less voids.<br>
                <i>Light-Fire</i> - Skin color is usually red or orange, eyes may be red, orange, 
                 yellow, or blue. Hair is typically red, yellow, or orange, and strands or bits
                 of it may dance on their own. Is very, very warm to the touch.<br>
                <i>Light-Radiant</i> - White to light yellow skin tones, white to yellow tones for hair
                 and eyes. Hair and/or eyes may start to glow gently during periods of great 
                 emotional excitement.<br>
                <i>Magic-Force</i> - Light to dark gray skin, hair, and eye tones. Hair may start to
                 float as if weightless or drop as though weighed down randomly.<br>
                <i>Magic-Illusion</i> - Purple to blue skin tones, eyes are a deep blue, green, or 
                 purple. Occasional gentle sparkles may appear around face or hands, or in the
                 eyes.<br>
                <i>Soul-Death</i> - Dark gray skin, variable hair and eye color. Body odor may be
                 more akin to a fresh corpse.<br>
                <i>Soul-Life</i> - Skin tones vary from pale green to turquoise to pale blue. Eye
                 color varies from green to blue, hair color tends to match skin color.<br>
                <i>Space-Air</i> - Light gray skin, white, gray, or light blue hair and eye color.
                 Hair frequently appears to float or billow softly unprompted.<br>
                <i>Space-Earth</i> - Skin color varies from dark brown to light green, variable eye 
                 and hair color. Hair is usually curly, and body odor is more akin to wet soil or cut grass.<br>
                <i>Time</i> - Normal, though slightly off-color skin, hair, and eye tones from
                 Heritage. Extremities and small parts such as hands, feet, eyes, and hair may
                 appear to move unnaturally quickly or slowly at random.<br>
                <b>Life Expectancy.</b> Elementia share the life expectancy and maturity rate of
                 their parents.<br>
                <b><a href="../../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size</a>.</b> You are the same Size as your 
                 parents’ Heritage(s).<br>

                 one other language of your choice (usually that of your parents' Heritage(s)), and the 
                 language of your element.<br>
                <b>Armor.</b> Your base Armor score is 1.<br>
                <b>Dodge Penalty.</b> If you are Small/Medium/Big, your Dodge Penalty is -2/-3/-4.<br>
