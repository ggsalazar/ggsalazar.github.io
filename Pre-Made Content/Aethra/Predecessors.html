			<h2>The First Sentients</h2>
			<p>The Predecessors were the first sentient race of intelligent beings on Aethra; they
			 were the gods' first creation, and in their eager, short-sighted excitement to create
			 true life, they were made nearly perfect. In this section is a brief overview of the
			 Predecessors’ time on Aethra, segmented into what the average educated lay person on
			 Aethra would know in the 153rd year of the Age of Peace (Common Knowledge), what a
			 scholar of Predecessor history would know in the same time period (Uncommon Knowledge),
			 and what has been lost to history - effectively, what only the gods (and by extension the
			 GM) would know (Unknown Knowledge).</p>

                <h2>What a Layperson Would Know</h2>
                <p>The information given here is relatively widely-known by those with at least
                 a basic education; when asking for Lore checks concerning information on the
                 Predecessors contained herein, the DR should be no more than 10.</p>
                
                <h2>The Predecessors</h2>
                <p>Existing long before the Sentients were the Predecessors, the gods’ first
                 attempt at creating sentient life to live and die on Aethra. These beings were 
                 nearly perfect in every way: they were gifted with the powers of Aether (able
                 to perform feats and abilities Sentient Aetherians could only dream of), they
                 were invariably strong, fast, wise, and tenacious, their bodies were sculpted
                 to perfection, they rarely needed to sleep or eat, and they would regularly live
				 to see a full millenium over the course of a single life. For 10,000 years they
				 built their civilizations unimpeded by monsters of any sort; however, they built 
				 so high, advanced so far, mastered everything the world had to offer by such a 
				 large degree, that they soon began to believe that they should be the rightful 
				 rulers of the universe - had they not surpassed their creators in every noteworthy
				 way? So, in an attempt to overthrow the gods themselves, their own makers, they
				 started the Predecessors’ War for Dominance, a conflict that lasted for over 3,000
				 years and irrevocably scarred the surface of Aethra.</p>

                <h2>What a Researcher Would Know</h2>
                <p>This section contains information which, though not commonly known, has been
                 studied and researched by scholars specializing in Predecessor history. DRs for
                 Lore checks pertaining to anything given in this section can range anywhere
                 from 11-40, depending on how obscure the GM feels the knowledge would be.</p>

                <h2>GM Knowledge Only</h2>
                <p>The information contained in this section could not be known to anyone on
                 Aethra by any typical or non-arcane means, and thus very, very few 
                 would know any of it. GMs should only reveal this information to players as
                 they discover it and as it becomes relevant, if they reveal it at all.</p>
                
				<h2>The Predecessors</h2>
				
				
				<h2>The War for Dominance</h2>
				<p>soon the gods began to fear for their 
                 superiority as the divine rulers of the universe, and became afraid that their
                 creations would one day subjugate and replace them. So, in an attempt to undo
                 what they had done and put a stop to the Predecessors’ advances, they started
                 the War for Dominance, a conflict that lasted for over 3000 years.</p>
				
                <h2>The Sentients</h2>
                <p>After the Cataclysm, the gods were... hesitant to replace the Predecessors 
                 with another generation of sentient life. For hundreds and hundreds of years they sat, 
                 trying to find ways to leave their planes, trying to think of ways to bring 
                 back what they had lost – all to no avail. Eventually, many of them began to 
                 feel a longing to create again. They wanted Aethra to thrive and flow with 
                 intelligent life, and seeing it as it was now – overrun with monsters and 
                 irrevocably scarred by millennia of war – disgusted and saddened many of them.
                 Not to mention, one by one they began to realize that sentient life was
                 beginning to occupy Aethra again anyway, as the Drakon evolved from the Kobolds,
                 Goblins began to evolve from Orks, and certain Beasts were becoming more and
                 more intelligent – enough to even be called sentient in their own right.</p>
                <p>So it came to be that the gods resolved to create sentient life anew – though
                 this time, they were determined to be far more cautious about it. So, they 
                 decided that the best course of action would be to create imperfect beings, who
                 were far more limited in scope, power, lifespan, and every other way in which 
                 the Predecessors had been nearly perfect. They debated and argued amongst each
                 other for untold years - dozens and dozens at least - but in the end agreed that instead of one 
                 sentient race, this new generation would be comprised of 4, each embodying one
                 of the core aspects of the Predecessors: the sapient Gnomes were granted their
                 intelligence; the hardy Dwarves embodied their incredible strength; the
                 graceful Elves were gifted their nimble finesse; and finally, the unyielding 
                 Humans were blessed with their undying tenacity. This new generation of 
                 Sentients would populate and take back Aethra from the Monstrosities that now
                 plagued it, and help heal and cover up the scars left by the Predecessors’ War 
                 for Dominance. Thus, as the sun rose on the first day of a new cycle, thousands
                 of the new Sentients were placed sporadically in the ruined cities across Ahkos,
                 and from there were left to their own devices to explore, populate, and rebuild
                 the world.</p>
