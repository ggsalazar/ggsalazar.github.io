            <h2>Aethra's Calendar</h2>
            <p>Given here is a thorough description of the Bahamian Calendar, the primary 
             calendar used on Aethra, named after the dead Titan Bahamut, created & 
             proliferated by the Adventurer’s Guild, and adopted by the continents of 
			 Ahkos, Northern Media and most of Frigus after the first few decades of the
			 Age of Peace. When using the world of Aethra for their adventures, GMs are
			 free to use this calendar as-is or modify it to their heart’s desires.</p>
            <p>The generalities of the calendar are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One day is 24 hours;</li>
                <li>One week is 6 days;</li>
                <li>One month is 5 weeks (30 days);</li>
                <li>One year is 12 months (60 weeks, 360 days).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The days are named thusly:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ichi;</li>
                <li>Ni;</li>
                <li>San;</li>
                <li>Yon;</li>
                <li>Go;</li>
                <li>Roku.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The cycle of the seasons are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Spring</b> occurs over the first 3 months of the year;</li>
                <li><b>Summer</b> occurs over the next 3 months, and the <b>Summer Solstice</b>,
                 the longest day of the year, marks its exact middle;</li>
                <li><b>Autumn</b> takes place over the 7th, 8th, and 9th months;</li>
                <li>Finally, <b>Winter</b> occupies the final 3 months of the year, and the 
                 <b>Winter Solstice</b>, the longest night, signals the end of the current year.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Months of the Cycle</h2>

            <h2>Holidays</h2>
            <p><b>Aether Day.</b> Denizens of most of the civilized world celebrate the wonders
             and powers of Aether, and by extension Aetherians, on the 21st of Thánatos. 
             Aetherians are usually treated to free meals and drinks, and are known to use their
             powers to put on spectacular shows and perform dazzling feats for the entertainment
             of crowds. Some places may hold parades, or put on special events or fairs, with
             Aetherians as the central recipient of the celebrations. Additionally, beings that
             sell Aether – such as governments and private enterprises – are a bit more lenient
             with the sale of Aether, and may even offer special reduced prices for the day.</p>
            <p><b>Predecessors' End.</b> The 9th of Pago is widely believed to be the day of the
             Cataclysm, the event that snuffed out the Predecessors. In celebration, workers are
             usually given a few days off, and parties and feasts are held amongst close friends
             and family and/or by governmental bodies.</p>
            <p><b>Media's Founding (Northern and Southern Media only).</b> Celebrated on the 
             11th of Aktino, this holiday celebrates the founding of the continent of Northern
             Media (and by extension Media as a whole) by explorers whose names have long been 
             forgotten by the 153rd year of the Age of Discovery. Celebrations usually include
             feasts, shows, and recreations (both artistic and theatrical) of historical legends
			 surrounding the discovery.</p>
            <p><b>The Hallowed Eve.</b> Colloquially referred to as Halloweeve and celebrated on
             the night of the 30th of Dyna, The Hallowed Eve is a time when most of the peoples 
             of the world choose to pay homage to their dead, doing so through the lighting of 
             candles, the making of figurines, visiting and decorating graves, wearing masks or
             face paint depicting the dead or cultural symbols of death, and the like. 
             Additionally, some communities see fit to throw parties, usually centering around
             celebrating the deeds of their ancestors or as simply a reminder to enjoy and 
             appreciate being alive.</p>
            <p><b>Last Eve/New Dawn.</b> Celebrated on the night of the 30th of Dýnami and the
             dawn of the 1st of Pyro and more formally referred to as the Winter Solstice, the
             Last Eve/New Dawn is the longest night of the year, signalling the end of the
             current year and the start of a new one. As this holiday draws near, workers are
             usually given the preceding and proceeding week off to spend with their families
             and loved ones, and as midnight rolls around on this night, many people make vows
             to better themselves in at least one way over the course of the new year. 
             Additionally, during the night, parties are thrown and feasts are held, and it is
             not uncommon for families and close friends to exchange gifts with one another.</p>
            <p><b>Longest Sun.</b> Formally known as the Summer Solstice and celebrated on the 
             30th of Zoi, the Longest Sun marks the longest day and exact middle of the 
             cycle and the end of Summer. To celebrate, workers are usually given a few days off
             and shops will hold special sales to commemorate the occasion. On the Solstice 
             itself, parades or fairs may be held celebrating the good that has and hopefully
             will occur during the year, and commiserating any unfortunate events that may have
             occurred up until that time.</p>
