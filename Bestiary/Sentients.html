            <p>Sentients, though incredibly varied, are also quite similar in a great many ways,
             making it relatively easy to give a broad framework that can be easily modified to suit
             any situation. In terms of truly special Sentient foes and NPCs, it is best to simply 
             create a character for them using the Rulebook as though you were making a character of 
             the appropriate level. A quick and easy way to modify any of the given stat blocks to 
             create more variety amongst your Sentient NPCs would be to roll 1d4 for each of their
             ability scores and add or subtract the result from the given score.</p>

                     low-level person that lives by the sword.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    The tactics of Combatants vary widely depending on the nature of the group; law enforcement
                     groups will engage their targets in an orderly, methodical, and (at least somewhat) trained
                     manner, fighting more or less in unison, whereas a group of, say, highwaymen will strike
                     individually from the shadows and act with relatively little discipline. In any case, most
                     Combatants will not find the cause they are fighting for worth their lives and will likely
                     flee if things start to turn against them (especially if their leader has fallen).

                     truly feel emotion or think for themselves; if anything, any emotion a Revenant "feels"
                     would just be the memory of that emotion from when they had their soul.

                    Once the Mind Eater has taken control of the host, they hijack the host's nervous system
                     and use them to serve the will of the Queen. Due to their hive mind, they are able to
                     act in an extremely efficient and well-organized manner, and are nearly immune to
                     being taken by surprise.

                    <b>Freeze Weakness.</b> If the Host's Health is reduced to 0 via freeze damage, they go
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> and at the start of their
                     next turn, the Mind Eater Queen slithers out of their nose, mouth, eye, or ear. If the 
                     Queen has not yet laid eggs in the Host's brain as per the <b>Incubator</b> ability, 
                     then the Host survives; otherwise, they die immediately.<br>
                    <b>Hive Mind.</b> The Host knows everything every other Host of the same colony does
                     via very rudimentary telepathy, so long as they are within 100 meters of each other.<br>
                    <b>Incubator.</b> After 6 days, the Queen lays 2d6 Mind Eater eggs in the Host's brain,
                     destroying however much brain tissue is needed to make room for the eggs without 
                     impairing the Host's motor functions; after another 6 days, these eggs hatch, typically
                     damaging much of the remaining brain tissue, rendering this Host unusable and forcing the
                     Queen to migrate to a new one.<br>
                    <b>Pain Tolerance.</b> The Host does not suffer from Health loss penalties.

                    Once the Queen has taken control of the host, they use them to command the other hosts of
                     the colony to further the Queen's goals, which is usually to expand the colony and ensure
                     its survival. Due to their hive mind, the hosts are able to act in an extremely
                     efficient and well-organized manner, and are practically immune to being taken by
                     surprise.
