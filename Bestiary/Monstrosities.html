                    <i>Small</i><br>
                    Dwelling exclusively in wetlands and dense jungles, Bog Crawlers
                     are ugly, thin little creatures that use guerrilla tactics -
                     specifically traps, hit-and-run strategies, and ambushes - to
                     catch and eat their prey. Their bodies are thin and scrawny,
                     and they cover themselves with various flora to serve as both
                     basic armor and to make themselves appear bigger than they
                     actually are. Their primary preferred weaponry consists of
                     sharpened sticks that they use as spears.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Bog Crawlers try to ambush unsuspecting prey in groups of 1d3+3, usually
                     while they are either resting or preoccupied with another activity. If 
                     their prey seems to be heading in a specific direction, they will attempt 
                     to set a basic <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter13.html">trap</a>, such as
                     a Hunting Trap (Suspension Snare modification) or a Pit. Once their prey is
                     defeated, they will drag their body/ies to the nearest perceived safe area,
                     where they will set up a fire to cook and eat it.

                    A Monstrosity that has mastered the art of deception, Mimics use their
                     <b>Perfect Disguise</b> ability to perfectly assume the form of any Small,
                     Medium, or Big object, from chests to weapons to doors to ladders to much
                     more; additionally, the adhesive that covers their skin is incredibly 
                     powerful, ensuring that any adventurer unlucky enough to be fooled into
                     touching them is near-hopelessly stuck. Once its prey is stuck in this way,
                     the Mimic will use its reaction to unfurl its arms and shove its prey into
                     its mouth to bite it; if there is further prey in the immediate vicinity,
                     the Mimic will also unfurl its legs, allowing it to flee or fight the 
                     unlucky adventurer’s companions.

                    <b>Adhesive Skin.</b> The Mimic emits a glue-like substance all over its
                     body that it uses to trap unwitting prey that touch it. Once a creature
                     touches a Mimic, they are <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                     by it and cannot escape the grapple without severing whatever is attached
                     to it; alternatively, the glue loses its strength a few minutes after the
                     Mimic dies.<br>
                    <b>Perfect Disguise.</b> The Mimic can take the appearance of any object
                     that is the same size as it; while not moving, the Mimic’s appearance 
                     perfectly matches that of the object it is imitating. In combat, the Mimic
                     grows a set of arms and legs that it uses to fight or flee.

                    <b>Bite.</b> Melee attack, 1 target, 3s, 4d8+3 physical damage; once
                     another creature touches the Mimic, it will immediately use its reaction to

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Mimics are solitary or small-group hunters, preferring to hunt in groups of 1d3.
                     Once the first Mimic has caught an unfortunate victim, the others
                     in the group (if there are any) will also show themselves,
                     distracting the rest of the party and allowing its feasting compatriot
                     to finish its prey off.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    More so than ordinary Mimics, Organic Mimics are solitary hunters, preferring to lure
                     a creature away from its group (if it has one in the first place) and feast on them in
                     secret; a particularly sadistic Organic Mimic will then assume <i>that</i> creature's
                     form, rejoin that creature's group, and rinse and repeat until it has hunted down the
                     entire group. Being struck with fire or acid will cause the Organic Mimic extreme agony,
                     causing it to reveal its true nature to those around it.

                    Horrible worms that slide into a creature’s brain through their eyes, ears, nose, or 
                     mouth, Mind Eaters hijack a person’s nervous system to take control of their body, using
                     it in service to their hive-minded colony. Should a Mind Eater’s host become unusable
                     (i.e. die) the Mind Eater will immediately leave the defunct host to find a new one. The
                     oldest living Mind Eater in a colony becomes the Mind Eater Queen, changing sexes if it
                     needs to in order to produce eggs for the colony. Because Mind Eaters live in hotter 
                     climes, they suffer when exposed to the cold, allowing for a method of killing the Mind

                     creature must succeed on a DR 25 Fort./Will. save (their choice) or the ME will take
                     possession of that creature. If that creature is a Sentient, they become a Mind Eater Host.
                     Should the host die (Sentient or not), the Mind Eater will immediately leave their body to

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Given their complete inability to fight, Mind Eaters always attempt to catch their prey
                     unawares, such as while they are sleeping, distracted, or otherwise disadvantaged. Once
                     they have their host, their hive mind makes them quite dangerous and surprisingly
                     cunning, able to execute group tactics with deadly efficiency. Additionally, all the 
                     Mind Eaters of a given colony are supremely loyal to their Queen, and will obey her will
                     to the best of their ability, even if it means putting themselves in danger.

                     (and eventually sentient) over time, Skaks instead became leaner and focused on the use of speed and agility to survive and wage war. Physically speaking, skaks are lean
                     and scrawny, with black hair and eyes, sharp teeth and nails, and beige-red skin. Skak Leaders specifically are slightly smarter than other Skaks, though still very
                     dextrous. SLs decide where the tribe goes, who they fight, and when the time comes for a "tactical retreat". Tribes always have only 1 leader.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Using information gathered by their scouts, Skak Leaders will lead tribes of 1d4+7 other Skaks to areas that they believe are either relatively safe and/or are currently
                     home to groups that the tribe believes are vulnerable and/or weak enough to be easily defeated and/or stolen/scavenged from. If the Leader believes the target group in
                     question is significantly weaker than them, then they will have no issue engaging them in open combat; otherwise, they will have the tribe lay traps and prepare an ambush
                     for the target group, or even attack them from stealth outright, such as while they are sleeping or distracted with something else. When the tribe attacks a target, Leaders
                     will typically stay out of the thick of the fighting, instead choosing to direct and command the rest of the tribe from a place of relative safety, putting their Commander's
                     Strike ability to use more frequently than their weapons.

                    Physically, Skak Scouts look very similar to Skak Leaders, though they are even scrawnier and more agile, and generally less intelligent. Most tribes will only have 2-4

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Scouts are most definitely not fighters, and will avoid combat at all costs, keeping a dagger on them more for utility than for any combative purposes.
                     Traveling only in groups of one or two, Scouts will take up to a few days to scout out an area that the Skak tribe is considering moving into, either 
                     for scavenging or just because that area is where the Skaks would like to move to next. If faced with combat, Skak Scouts will flee at the earliest
                     available opportunity, thinking nothing of leaving their partner behind if it means saving themselves. When the tribe attacks a target, Scouts put their
                     Precision Attack feature to use on targets that are distracted or otherwise disadvantaged. If the rest of the tribe appears to be losing the fight, Scouts
                     will have no second thoughts about running to live another day and finding another tribe to put their skills to use for.

                    From the waist up, Gorgons resemble Sentients with incredibly horrible 
                     visages, including a nest of snakes in lieu of hair. From the waist down,
                     they are serpent-like, with long tails that they use to slither around on 
                     the ground with instead of legs. Their likenesses are so horrifyingly ugly
                     that they have the power to petrify any who look upon them, turning them to
                     stone over the course of a few seconds. Because of this power, Gorgons make
                     for popular guardians, including by Sentients who are able to convince them
                     to come into their employ. The statues of their victims make for excellent

                     Basilisks, are decorated with the statues of their victims, Gorgon lairs
                     tend to be more open in their spacing and not as cramped as a Basilisk’s.

                     they will take advantage of this by sneaking up on and ambushing their prey, hoping to catch them by surprise before they can cover their eyes. Of course, even if their foe(s) survive their

                    Having somehow gained the powers of Aether, Ork Spellmakers make for an interesting opponent: their simple minds are unable to
                     formulate strategic methods of utilizing their spells, but their application of their arcane power, unfettered by such trifles
                     as "strategy" or "concern for their comrades", make them uniquely terrifying compared to their Warrior brethren. Like Ork
                     Warriors, Spellmakers also view ranged warfare as "cowardly", however are slightly more inclined to it given their innate 
                     access to it. Ork war parties, like Skak tribes, rarely have more than 1 Spellmaker, if they even have that 1.

                     Aether proficiency is 4 instead of 3; it uses its CHA for its spell damage bonus and ASDR, which is 17.<br>

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Given that Orks view ranged warfare as cowardly and less than, Ork Spellmakers are only slightly less likely than their Warrior brethren
                     to rush headlong into battle and start mercilessly attacking their target(s), this time using mainly spells instead of a weapon or their
                     fists, unless they feel they need to for some reason. Orks also don't really care about the well-being of their comrades, so if they - or
                     the Spellmaker themself - happen to get caught in the AoE of the Spellmaker's spells, then so be it.

                     leading packs of 1d4 +2 other Ork Warriors (and occasionally Spellmakers), Ork Warlords decide where the pack goes and who they attack next,
                     seeking only to sate their insatiable bloodlust.

                    <b>Warcry.</b> Sphere (20m), 3s: the OW lets out a bellowing, blood-curdling scream of rage, causing all Orks in the AoE to enter into

                     of the OW for the next minute, or only 30 seconds on a Partial Success; creatures who fail the save can repeat it at the end of each of their turns to end the effect
                     early on them (Partial Successes reduce the duration by half); a creature who succeeds against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Unlike the commanders of Sentient militaries or the weak and cowardly Skak Leaders, Ork Warlords lead the charge into the fray themselves,
                     and the word "retreat" never once pops into their head under any circumstances. An Ork Warlord will start a battle using its Warcry ability,
                     then run screaming into the thickest parts of battle and the toughest-looking enemies themselves, rarely using their Commander's Strike
                     ability as they prefer to secure kills themselves whenever possible.

                    Orks are simple creatures: all they want, all they crave, is bloodshed. Combat, war, the feel of blades tearing through flesh,
                     bones shattering under the weight of heavy blows, blood spattering across the ground: all of these things are music to an Ork's
                     ears. On Aethra, Orks share an ancestor with modern-day Goblins and Skaks, being descended from a war-mongering race of monsters
                     that were explicitly designed to wage war against the near-perfect Predecessors. Generally hulking, muscular, and various shades
                     of red in appearance, the sight of an Ork war party is enough to make any lone traveler fill their britches with fear.

                    Orks have little-to-no mind for strategy, instead prefer to bum-rush their opponents and attempt to overwhelm them with their incredible
                     strength and sheer ferocity. They also view ranged combat as cowardly and shameful, and so would never engage in it unless <b>absolutely</b>
                     necessary. Ork war parties are typically made up of 1d4+2 Ork Warriors and an Ork Warlord (plus the occasional Spellmaker), and always
                     travel (and fight) together.

                    scope out an area or force that they either plan on attacking or believe will attack
                    them soon. Though the Scouts are not supposed to attack their target, it is not an
                    uncommon occurrence if they believe they can defeat the force they are scouting.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Acting on knowledge gathered from the Scouts, Sahuagin tribes
                    will send parties of Warriors, led by at least one Warchief
                    depending on the size of the party to attack their target. To
                    give themselves an added advantage, the war party will try to 
                    strike at night or at some other time when their quarry least
                    suspects it. If the war party is split up, Sahuagin Warriors 
                    will try to move in groups of 3-5 if they can. There is typically
                    1 Sahuagin Warchief per group of 10-15 Warriors.

                    Sahuagin Warchiefs, a terrifying and powerful force on their own,
                    typically lead war parties of some 10-15 Sahuagin Warriors, 
                    acting on intelligence gathered by Sahuagin Scouts. Though 
                    typically Warchiefs prefer to stay back and observe the fight to
                    ensure all is going well, it is not unheard of for them to give
                    into their bloodlust and join the fray themselves, almost always
                    turning it into an outright bloodbath.

                    to do that when the need arises as well.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    As guards over a given area, Scarecrows will typically rely on their <b>Frightening
                    Visage</b> to keep would-be intruders away, though if that is not enough, then they
                    will stalk their prey and wait to ambush them at the most opportune moment. Depending
                    on the will of their master, they will either knock their foes 
                    <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> and then deposit them outside
                    of the guarded area after the fight, or simply kill them outright. If it kills Sentients,
                    then it will take trophies from their bodies (i.e. severed body parts) and decorate 
                    itself with them in order to enhance its <b>Frightening Visage</b>. Additionally, 
                    because their bodies are so naturally frail, it is not uncommon for Scarecrows to be
                    outfitted with proper armor by their master to make up for this weakness.

                    Easily the beefiest of a given group of Skaks, Skak Warriors are the fighters and rule enforcers of the tribe, using their skills whenever the tribe engages
                    their chosen target in warfare. Outside of combat, they enforce their leader's rules as needed and hunt and scavenge food for the tribe whenever their stolen
                    or pillaged stores run low. Because of Skaks' unrefined methods of making weapons and armor, they are unable to create swords that would put their natural
                    finesse to use, and so use their STR score when attacking with their blades. If a Skak Warrior were to find a sword that could use their DEX, they likely
                    would choose not to use it anyway, either preferring their own blade or not realizing they can use their dexterity to enhance their strikes. Warriors make up
                    the majority of any given Skak tribe, typically making two-thirds or more of the tribe itself.

                    Skak Warriors, though tough, are rather simple-minded, with no aptitude for strategy, which is instead handled by their Leader. No, Skak Warriors will instead
                    typically bum-rush their foes, believing their numbers and strength will be enough to take their opponents down, especially when they are caught by surprise.
                    Additionally, unless explicitly ordered to by their Leader, Skak Warriors have little fear of death or desire to surrender or retreat, and will typically fight
                    to the death if that is what their current situation entails. Given that Skak tribes typically vary from 8-12 in size, any tribe members that are not the Leader,
                    the Scouts, or the Spellslingers are then Warriors (typically about 4-8 Warriors depending on tribe composition).

                    Tall, hairless, lanky creatures with blue-gray skin, red eyes, long noses, and sharp teeth, Trolls are widely known (and feared) for their incredible regenerative abilities, being absolutely
                     impossible to kill short of being burned or melted to death (or vaporized, but very few possess the ability to do that). Their regenerative abilities are so strong, in fact, that it is how Trolls
                     reproduce, with new Trolls growing wholesale out of the severed appendages of other Trolls.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Trolls are, naturally, aware of their incredible regenerative abilities, and because of them, are not afraid of pretty much anything, confident
                     that their regeneration will see them through an otherwise impossible fight. That being said, they are keenly aware that fire and acid will hamper their regeneration, and will become
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a> and flee if either of those things come within a few meters of them; they will also be cautious of getting caught in traps or being
                     rendered immobile since both could easily mean a painful fiery death awaits them shortly thereafter. Aside from that, Trolls typically travel in groups of 1d4, but have a tendency not to fight
                     defensively unless they are aware of the presence of any nearby fire or acid.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Ice Phoenixes typically roost and hunt alone, fighting off invaders with their claws,
                     beak, and of course, their cold breath. Should they successfully slow a creature with 
                     their breath, they will attempt to pick the fighter up, fly to the nearest cliff (or 
                     several dozen meters into the air), and drop the afflicted from a great height. Due
                     to their vulnerability to fire, an Ice Phoenix is 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a> of flames and heat sources, and
                     will likely flee outright if it sees fire, especially if it is injured.

                    Wyverns at first appear very similar to dragons, except that they do not have forelegs, their claws instead on the ends of
                     their wings, which double as their forelegs. Additionally, wyverns come in three varieties: brown ones that use piercing
                     scream attacks, brownish-green ones that projectile vomit acid, and brownish-red ones that breathe fire. Additionally, no
                     Wyverns are resistant to their respective attack types.

                    <hr>
                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Typically traveling in groups of 1d4, Wyverns like to use their breath weapons to harry and wear down 
                     their targets in hit-and-run style attacks until they are ready to be finished off, at which point they
                     will come in and finish their prey off personally; if their is more than one Wyvern attacking the same
                     target, they may fight with each other over who gets the remains. Additionally, as airborne creatures,
                     Wyverns will not land to engage a target unless absolutely necessary, and will be very, very hesitant to
                     so much as enter an enclosed space, much less fight in one. Should a Wyvern be trained and used for
                     Sentient warfare, then they will be paired with riders who will control where they go and when, what, and
                     who they use their breath weapon on.

                     <b>Petrifying Gaze</b>. Basilisks are vulnerable to weapons that

                    <h4>Lair</h4>
                    Basilisks love to collect prey that they have petrified, taking 
                     them back to their lairs in order to use them as decorations to
                     create macabre menageries comprised of various creatures – 
                     usually Sentients – frozen in horror until they crumble into
                     dust. Because a Basilisk lives in its lair, the area is usually
                     saturated in its venom, causing the damage from its 
                     <b>Slithering Venom</b> to increase to 2d12+5. Basilisks typically
                     make their lairs in large, open caverns, or in cave systems with
                     many interconnecting tunnels.

                    The Chimera, the proud and powerful beast that it is, prefers to fight alone,
                     and is not afraid of much due to the versatility of its heads. That being
                     said, the Chimera is not stupid, and will not wander into an obvious trap
                     or let itself be caught unawares, keeping at least one head awake while the 
                     other two sleep or are occupied with something else.

                    As the name would imply, Giants are, well, giant. Ranging from 5 - 10 meters tall, Giants strike a unique mixture of awe and fear
                     in those who behold them. They are not always outright hostile to Sentients, but neither do they make any great effort to be on
                     good terms with them, and view them more akin to how Sentients might view rodents or other annoying, invasive pests. The appearance
                     of giants is incredibly varied, though their skin (whilst incredibly thick) is almost always light blue or brown with a tint of gray.
                     They also tend to have long, mangy hair and beards, with incredibly thick legs and arms.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Giants are not particularly war-minded, and so do not really consider the tactical aspect of war all that often.
                     Additionally, they rarely have need for tactics, as their immense size and strength is nearly always enough to carry
                     them through whatever combat comes their way. Other than that, Giants are generally solitary creatures, rarely traveling
                     in groups greater than 3.

                    The Behemoth is the true epitome of the Monstrosity: a colossal creature with massive
                     horns, teeth like stalagmites and stalactites, claws as long as glaives, and a hunger
                     that seems to be insatiable. No one knows its origins or its purpose, but what is
                     known is that this horror is among the greatest monstrous threats that Sentients know 
                     of, and requires a small army just to be taken down. When any town, settlement, or
                     city feels the tremble of its footfalls and the echo of its cacophonous roar, prayers
                     are uttered, precious belongings are packed, and fighters are kissed goodbye – many
                     for the last time.
