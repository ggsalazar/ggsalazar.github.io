            <p>Undead are horrible monsters that originate from the Plane of Soul - the Dead 
             Lands specifically - yet are able to reproduce and replicate with living beings,
             including and especially Sentients, typically through infection or some unnatural
             conversion process. Undead creatures are called such because of the 
             state of their existence: they are neither living nor dead, yet they function, have
             goals, follow orders, and act on their instincts. Undead are feared by many, and
             not without good reason; the appearance of Undead outside of the Plane of Soul is
             almost never a good thing, and bloodshed is almost certain to follow.</p>
            <p>Throughout the Dead Lands, Undead prowl, looking for Specters to consume and destroy 
             for good. Most lower-Tier (and, not coincidentally, lower-INT) Undead, such as
             Zombies and Ghouls, simply roam and aimlessly look for Specters to consume, and on
             their own are no major threat, though packs of them can quickly become a major 
             problem. Higher-Tier/higher-INT Undead, like Vampyre Lords, plot, plan, and scheme their
             way to consuming Specters, and in so doing are usually much more successful and 
             much more feared.</p>

                     except that they give off a sickening orange glow, and are much
                     more likely to lead unwary travelers to their demise rather than
                     simply lead them astray. Once a traveler has met their doom in
                     the vicinity of a Deadlight - or more often, a cluster of them -
                     the haunting wisps will feed on their soul as it vacates their

                    <h4>Passive Abilities</h4>
                    <b>Alluring Appearance.</b> A creature that sees the Deadlight must
                     succeed on a DR 16 Willpower save or become
                     <a href = "../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">charmed</a> by it for 
                     the next hour (30 minutes on a Partial Success); this DR increases
                     by 1 for each additional Deadlight the creature sees, to a maximum
                     of 20. A creature can attempt this save again once every 10 minutes
                     until the effect wears off or if another creature attempts to bring
                     them out of their trance, ending the effect early on a success. A
                     creature that succeeds on this save is immune to this effect for 24 hours.<br>
                    <b>Death Sense.</b> The Deadlight can sense whenever a creature within
                     30m dies or starts the process of Enduring.

                    <h4>Actions</h4>
                    <b>Necromancy.</b> The Deadlight has 10 Mana that it can use to cast the following
                     spells: <i>Hell's Bells</i>, <i>Die</i>, <i>Knockout</i>, and <i>Psychosomatic</i>;
                     due to its low DEX, the Casting Time of these spells is increased by .5 seconds.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Deadlights are too simple, unintelligent, and overall weak to wage any
                     sort of conflict on their own; at most, they might lure a lone traveler
                     into some sort of deadly environmental hazard, such as off a cliff.
                     Instead, smarter and more capable creatures will team up with clusters
                     of 2+1d4 Deadlights, using them to lure wanderers into their lairs to
                     make killing them that much easier.

                    A very simple Undead that is comprised entirely of just the bones of a 
                     creature, a Skeleton is simply a mindless drone that aimlessly wanders the
                     Dead Lands, looking for Specters to consume. On other planes, a 
                     Skeleton mindlessly follows the orders of whoever summoned or created it.<br>
                    <b>Monstrous Skeleton.</b> The Skeleton statistics assume the Skeleton is
                     that of a Sentient, but this does not always need to be the case. In the 
                     case of monstrous Skeletons, it is best to modify the creature’s existing
                     statistics to account for its new lack of life and flesh.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Skeletons are not intelligent enough to form battle plans or think 
                     strategically on their own, and when left to their own devices will 
                     mindlessly attack whatever non-Undead they happen to come across. That being
                     said, if someone or something is leading them or commanding their loyalty,
                     they can be a terrifying force to deal with, as they do not fear death,
                     get tired, or need to sleep, and they eat souls.

                    A Specter, also known as a ghost, is the soul of a Sentient whose physical
                     body has expired. Most of the time, when a Sentient dies, a Reaper quickly
                     retrieves their soul and escorts it to the Dead Lands, where it will
                     eventually be consumed and destroyed by a native Undead. Alternatively, some 
                     Specters are able to stick around on the Central Plane, typically
                     those with a great emotional connection to an object or location near to
                     where they died.<br>

                     immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Should the Specter attempt to force the

                    Specters on the Central Plane are not fighters, and do not actively seek
                     to consume souls like other Undead. Rather, Specters on the Central Plane
                     prefer to stick close to the place or object that they were attached to
                     when they died, typically out of a desire to either protect it from others
                     or protect others from it. To achieve this goal, they will either use their
                     <b>Haunting Visage</b> to scare trespassers off or <b>Possess</b> the body
                     of a more capable fighter to keep intruders at bay, including through

                    A Zombie is very similar to a Skeleton in pretty much every sense, except that it is a 
                     walking, rotting corpse instead of bones.<br>
                    <b>Infectious Zombie.</b> An Infectious Zombie has the following addition to their 
                     <b>Bite</b> action: A creature who takes final damage from this attack must succeed on
                     a DR 20 Fortitude save or be afflicted with Zombification, a disease that leaves them 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> and will cause them to become a
                     Zombie 4d12 hours after being bitten unless they imbibe a Potion of Cure Disease or an
                     <i>exalted</i> Potion of Healing. A creature reduced to 0 Health while afflicted with 
                     this disease immediately dies and rises again in 1d10 minutes as a Zombie.<br>
                    <b>Monstrous Zombie.</b> The Zombie statistics assume the Zombie is that of
                     a Sentient, but this does not always need to be the case. In the case of 
                     monstrous Zombies, it is best to modify the creature’s existing statistics
                     to account for its new lack of life and living flesh.

                     will mindlessly attack whatever non-Undead they happen to come across. That
                     being said, if someone or something is leading them or commanding their
                     loyalty, they can be a terrifying force to deal with, as they do not
                     fear death, get tired, or need to sleep, and they eat both flesh and souls.

                    A Runner Zombie is a rotting, decaying corpse that still has good use and 
                     control over its body, and is usually in far better shape than their normal
                     counterparts. Whereas regular Zombies are barely an inconvenience, Runner
                     Zombies can be absolutely terrifying and a real threat, especially in

                     overwhelm their prey in sheer force and numbers. When engaging in combat, Runners
                     will almost always attempt to <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">tackle</a>

                     and fight back. Typically, Life Drinkers will attack in groups of 2 + 1d4.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Given their large size, Necrowings don't feel the need to travel in large groups, 
                     typically travelling (and by extension attacking) in groups of 1d4. When they do attack,
                     they prefer to use their Necromancy to keep their prey terrified and disorganized, 
                     while using flying hit-and-run attacks to do maximal damage with minimal risk, unless 
                     they are forced to the ground for some reason.

                    An Undead that is unique in the sense that it specifically targets Sentients
                     and not other Undead, a Poltergeist can be thought of as an advanced 
                     Specter; when a Specter has spent many years on the Central Plane, becoming
                     more and more enraged and/or unhinged due to a combination of loneliness, 
                     unresolved business, spending far too much time on the wrong plane of 
                     existence, or some other cause, they become a Poltergeist, murderous and 
                     outright hostile towards any Sentients that have the misfortune of 
                     encountering them. This change gives them a somewhat new form, one that
                     reflects their viler nature, as well as some new abilities.

                     them for the next hour, or only 30 minutes on a Partial Succes; they can repeat this 
                     save every 10 minutes so long as they cannot see or hear the Poltergeist, ending the 
                     effect early on a success. A creature that succeeds this save is immune to this effect
                     for the next 24 hours.<br>
                    <b>Incorporeal.</b> The Poltergeist can become incorporeal over the course of 1 second,
                     becoming <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">invisible</a> and
                     allowing them to move through solid objects with no difficulty, as well as 
                     making them immune to damage. They must take another second to become 
                     physical again, allowing them to attack and be attacked.<br>
                    <b>Telekinesis.</b> The Poltergeist can lift and throw objects with their

                     Telekinesis class feat, with the following restrictions: the object(s) cannot weigh more
                     than 250 pounds and cannot be more than 30 meters away from the Poltergeist. They can 
                     exert fine control over objects while incorporeal, but throwing them or using them in 
                     combat ends their incorporeality.

                    <h4>Actions</h4>
                    <b>Possess.</b> 1 target, 3 seconds, DR 20 Willpower save; the Poltergeist 
                     attempts to take possession of the target’s body, placing them fully under
                     their control for the next 24 hours, at which point the Poltergeist is
                     forced out. Should the target fail the initial save, they can repeat it at
                     the end of every hour while possessed. A target that succeeds on this save
                     is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Should the Poltergeist attempt
                     to force the target to knowingly harm or kill themselves, they are forced out.<br>
                    <b>Telekinetic Throw.</b> Ranged attack (30), 1 target, 1s, 4 proficiency, +1 damage.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    There is typically only one Poltergeist per haunted location, though particularly large
                     locations (such as abandoned insane asylums) may have multiple, and they may share 
                     territories in this location or seclude themselves to their own segment of their chosen
                     haunt. When intruders do find their way into the Poltergeist's lair, the Poltergeist
                     will typically allow them to get quite deep into the location, using their Telekinesis
                     to trap their victims inside and cut off their routes of escape, then using a combination
                     of their Horrifying Visage, Possess, and Telekinesis abilities to both frighten and kill
                     the intruders as they desire. Should they possess a creature and use them for violence,
                     they will fight with frenzy and absolute abandon, not caring if their victim is injured or
                     killed in the fray - if anything, they would prefer such an outcome.

                    When a Sentient is killed by a Vampyre or Vampyre Lord, and their corpse fed or injected
                     with that same Vampyre’s blood, they become a Minor Vampyre Spawn. The Spawn is no 
                     longer sentient by any stretch, and is essentially a walking talking drone under the 
                     Vampyre’s control, an extension of their will. A typical Vampyre can only have one,
                     maybe 2 Minor Spawn, while a Vampyre Lord can have up to 6 Minor Spawn, 2 Major Spawn, or
                     some combination of the two under their control at once; any more and their will would 
                     be overextended. Should the controlling Vampyre die, the Minor Spawn under its control
                     will immediately be subjected to fatal seizures, dying within a couple of minutes.<br>

                    <h4>Passive Abilities</h4>
                    <b>Blood Acuity.</b> The Minor Spawn has advantage on Perception checks to detect bleeding
                     creatures.<br>
                    <b>Blood Thirst.</b> The Minor Spawn must drink at least 1 quart of Sentient blood
                     a day or they will begin to starve and eventually die, losing Health equivalent to
                     25% of its Maximum (18) for every 24 hours that it goes without the necessary amount
                     of blood; this Health cannot be regained until the Spawn slakes its thirst.<br>
                    <b>Regeneration.</b> The Minor Spawn regains 1d2 +1.5 Health at the start of
                     each of their turns while their Health is >0 and they are not on fire.<br> 
                    <b>Vampyre Climb.</b> The Spawn can climb vertical surfaces and upside-down

                    <b>Bite.</b> Melee attack (short), 1 target, 1.5s, 4d6 +3 physical damage: if 
                     the Spawn deals final damage with this attack, they can attempt to 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">grapple</a> the target as part of

                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a> by the Spawn, 3s, 1d6 +3 
                     final rot damage; the target’s Maximum Health is reduced by the amount of damage dealt
                     until their next day’s rest; a target reduced to 0 Health via this attack dies instantly
                     and their soul is immediately consumed by the Spawn unless the victim has
                     precautionary measures in place, such as a Soul Jar or the <i>Death Ward</i> spell.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Vampyre Lords rarely separate their Minor Spawn, given that by themselves they are fairly
                     weak and vulnerable. As such, the Minor Spawn are almost always together, unless given a
                     task that they believe is relatively safe/low-risk and can be done fairly quickly, or
                     that they must be alone for, such as subterfuge or some other such mission; in fact, due
                     to their frailty, Minor Spawn are typically sent on clandestine tasks (e.g. theft, 
                     intelligence gathering, assassination, etc.) that are unlikely to involve combat, since
                     they would probably not survive any sort of violent skirmish with a trained and 
                     well-armed force. Additionally, to make up for their poor natural defenses, Vampyre 
                     Lords will outfit their Spawn with whatever armor they need or are otherwise most
                     comfortable with. When the Minor Spawn do have to do battle, they will typically try to
                     gang up on individual combatants in order to finish each one off as quickly as possible.
                     Lastly, Minor Spawn will almost never use weapons unless deemed absolutely necessary,
                     believing their teeth and claws to be enough to finish off any potential opponent.

                     they can repeat it at the end of every hour while possessed. A target that succeeds on
                     this save is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Should the Wraith attempt

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Wraiths do not necessarily oppose working with other creatures, but prefer to be left to
                     their own devices whenever possible. During combat, a Wraith will hang back, out of the
                     thick of the fighting, using their spells to pick off targets and support their allies
                     as much as possible. Should they become the subject or target of a creature's attacks,
                     they will use their Incorporeal feature (or their spells if that is the better option)
                     to get themselves to safety; if they feel the battle is turning against their side or
                     is otherwise doomed for failure, they will abandon the fighting altogether and flee to
                     safety.

                    When a particularly intelligent, wise, or strong-willed Sentient (or an Aetherian) is
                     made into a Vampyre Spawn, they become a Major Vampyre Spawn, as opposed to a Minor 
                     Spawn. This Spawn does have a will of their own, and though they are usually loyal to 
                     the Vampyre Lord that created them, there is enough will in them to allow for a degree 
                     of freedom, though to call them sentient would be misleading. Cases of Major Vampyre 
                     Spawns becoming disloyal to their creator are heard of, but are incredibly rare. When
                     the controlling Vampyre Lord dies, Major Spawns will suffer a terrible migraine and be
                     reduced to 1 Health for the next 24 hours, dying if they do not feed by the end of that
                     time. After that, they are effectively free beings, no longer under their Lord's control
                     and able to continue their existence in any way they see fit until they die of old age,
                     which takes about 400 years to occur after their controlling Lord has died.<br>
                    Like their creators, Vampyre Spawns Major and Minor feast on the blood of living 
                     Sentients to survive. Additionally, another factor that makes Major Vampyre Spawns 
                     unique is that they are able to breed with living Sentients, creating Dhampir.<br>

                    <b>Animancy.</b> The Major Spawn is a 5th-level 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Animancer</a> that can only cast Death
                     spells; it uses its CHA for its spell damage bonus and ASDR, which is 17; due to their DEX, the Casting
                     Time of spells is reduced by .5 seconds; if they were already an Aetherian in life, they retain those abilities and do
                     not gain this ability.<br>
                    <b>Bite.</b> Melee attack (short), 1 target, 3s, 5d6 +4 physical damage; if

                     instantly and their soul is immediately consumed by the Major Spawn unless the victim has

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Major Vampyre Spawn, given their more sapient and overall capable nature, are usually
                     entrusted with matters that are important to the Vampyre Lord or are otherwise required
                     for the Lord's over-arching plans. In combat, they prefer to hang back and command 
                     their forces from a position of relative safety, supporting them with spells and only
                     engaging in the fray when necessary. Additionally, though it is not reflected in
                     their statistics, Major Spawn will wear armor whenever they are away from their homes
                     or whatever other place they deem safe.

                    Intelligent and nefarious (though prideful to the point of hubris) Undead that bear the
                     appearance of tall humanoid Sentients, with the exceptions of an extra eye on each side
                     of their face, a propensity to click their jaws when they speak, and a tendency to 
                     salivate heavily in the presence of Sentient blood, Vampyres are powerful beings 
                     justifiably feared the world over. They are fierce, frenzied hunters who will stop at
                     nothing to satisfy their hunger, using their arachnid characteristics to stalk and trap
                     their prey, which they will keep alive for the dual purposes of having a fresh blood
                     supply on-hand and because they revel in their victims' fear and agony. Standard
                     Vampyres are not functionally immortal (living about a thousand years or so), though
                     they do seem that way to Sentients.

                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    Vampyres believe themselves better than Sentients in every way: stronger, smarter, older
                     and with more abilities than the vast majority of them. Because of this, they tend to
                     underestimate their prey, and have no issues pursuing prey by themselves or with their
                     Spawn (if they have one) in tow, even if they have banded together to form a hunting or
                     war party for whatever reason. In regards to weapons and armor, it varies based on the
                     preferences of each individual Vampyre, though they will never wear Heavy Armor as it
                     restricts their movement too much. If they are faced with a particularly tough opponent,
                     the Vampyre will take the time to craft a trap using their webbing, spider friends, and
                     Aether.

                    An intelligent, conniving, and functionally immortal Undead that seeks 
                     consumption of souls – living or dead – above all else. Vampyre Lords are known
                     to have schemes that last for decades, or sometimes even centuries, 
                     accruing knowledge, wisdom, and experience all the while, with the goal of 
                     cultivating as much livestock for their unceasing hunger as possible. As 
                     intelligent beings, Vampyre Lords do, of course, have other goals, interests,
                     hobbies, what-have-you, but their primary concern is always on where – and
                     who – their next meal is coming from.<br>
                    Bigger than Sentients and even lesser Vampyres, Vampyre Lords are also more arachnid
                     in appearance and behavior, with their lower halves bearing the appearance of a Dire
                     Spider and their upper halves bearing 4 arms, with their faces covered with 6 black
                     eyes and their jaws decorated with a pair of vicious mandibles. Using their Spawns
                     as proxies and agents of their will, Vampyre Lords almost never leave their lairs,
                     filling them with webs, spiders, and the coccoons of their countless victims accrued
                     over their centuries of existence.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Lair</h4>
                    Making their homes in massive, ancient castles in the Dead Lands, Vampyre Lords, despite
                     their arachnid nature, still have a taste for the arts and finer things, and so will
                     decorate their homes with paintings, statues, grand chandeliers, and other works of art,
                     which they will proceed to cover in webs, spider eggs, and the coccoons of their victims
                     over the course of their unending lives.

                    <h4>Passive Abilities</h4>
                    <b>4 arms.</b> The Vampyre Lord has 4 arms and can perform up to 2 actions simultaneously.<br>
                    <b>Beast Telepathy (Spiders).</b> The Vampyre Lord can communicate with all spiders within
                     30m of it via telepathy.<br>
                    <b>Blood Acuity.</b> The Vampyre Lord has advantage on Perception checks to detect
                     bleeding creatures.<br>
                    <b>Blood Thirst.</b> The Vampyre Lord must drink at least 1 gallon of Sentient blood
                     every day or they will begin to starve and eventually die, losing Health equivalent
                     to 25% of its Maximum (79) for every 24 hours that it goes without the necessary amount
                     of blood; this Health cannot be regained until the Vampyre Lord slakes its thirst. If
                     the Vampyre Lord consumes a soul, then their thirst is sated for 3 days.<br>
                    <b>Decapitation.</b> If a creature targets the Vampyre Lord’s neck with a bladed
                     weapon and deals <u>></u>25 final damage in a single turn with that weapon, they
                     decapitate the Lord. If the Lord’s heart is being pierced when this happens or they are
                     on fire, they die instantly; otherwise, the Lord can move about as normal, and can 
                     reattach its head by holding it back in its proper place for 3 seconds; if the head is
                     destroyed, a new one grows over the course of 6 seconds.<br>
                    <b>Foot in the Grave.</b> The Vampyre Lord has advantage on saves against poisons and
                     diseases.<br>
                    <b>Punctured Heart.</b> If a creature targets the Vampyre Lord’s heart with a piercing 
                     weapon and deals <u>></u>25 final damage in a single turn with that weapon, they 
                     pierce the Lord through the heart, rendering them 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">paralyzed</a> either for the next minute 
                     (after which the weapon is ejected from their heart) or until the implement is removed.
                     The Lord does not regenerate during this time. If the Lord is decapitated while in this
                     state, or if the Lord's heart is punctured while headless, they die instantly.<br>
                    <b>Misty Escape.</b> Should the Vampyre Lord be reduced to 0 Health and is not on fire
                     or being pierced through the heart, they immediately shapeshift into a cloud of mist
                     (see <b>Shapeshifting</b> below) and can only take the Move action; after 1d10 days, 
                     they reform into their original form at 1 Health. If they are being pierced through the
                     heart, they go <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">unconscious</a> until they are
                     no longer being pierced through the heart (at which point they become mist) or they are
                     decapitated or lit on fire (which kills them instantly).<br>
                    <b>Regeneration.</b> The Vampyre Lord regains 1d6 +2.5 Health at the start of each
                     of their turns while not being pierced through the heart.<br>
                    <b>Vampyre Climb.</b> The Vampyre Lord can climb vertical surfaces and upside-down
                     without needing to make a check.<br>
                    <b>Web Sense.</b> While in contact with a web, the Vampyre Lord knows the exact location
                     of any other creature in contact with the same web.<br>
                    <b>Web Walker.</b> The Vampyre Lord ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Actions</h4>
                    <b>Animancy.</b> The Vampyre Lord is a 10th-level 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part4/Aetherian.html">Animancer</a> that can only cast Death and
                     Decay spells; it uses its CHA for its spell damage bonus and ASDR, which is 27; due to 
                     their DEX, the Casting Time of these spells is reduced by 1.5 seconds.<br>
                    <b>Hypnosis (3/midnight).</b> The Vampyre Lord can cast the <i>Charm</i> (Magimancy)
                     spell over the course of 3 seconds on any creature that they are making eye contact
                     with and within 15m of.<br>
                    <b>Shapeshifting.</b> The Vampyre Lord can take 3 seconds to become any one of the
                     following: a cloud of mist (flying movement 10m/sec); their original 
                     form; a humanoid, Sentient-like version of itself that is 2-2.5 meters tall.<br>
                    <b>Summon Giant Spiders (3/midnight).</b> The Vampyre Lord can take 6 seconds to summon
                     1d4 <a href="./Beasts.html">Giant Spiders</a> that will protect the Vampyre Lord or
                     attack the Vampyre Lord's foes, at the Lord's discretion.<br>
                    <b>Bite.</b> Melee attack (short), 1 target, 2 seconds, 7d6 +6 physical damage; if the
                     Vampyre Lord deals final damage with this attack, they can attempt to 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">grapple</a> the target as part of the same
                     action.<br>
                    <b>Claws.</b> Melee attack, 1 target, .5s, 7d6 +7 physical damage.<br>
                    <b>Drink.</b> Melee attack, 1 target that is 
                     <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a> by the Vampyre Lord, 2s,
                     4d8 +7 final rot damage: the target’s Maximum Health is reduced by the amount of damage
                     dealt until their next day’s rest; a target reduced to 0 Health via this attack dies 
                     instantly and their soul is immediately consumed by the Vampyre Lord unless the victim 
                     has precautionary measures in place, such as a Soul Jar or the <i>Death Ward</i> spell..<br>
                    <b>Weapon Attack.</b> Any weapon, 1 target, .5s+ (depending on the weapon), +7
                     (STR)/+6 (DEX) damage.<br>
                    <b>Web.</b> The Vampyre Lord, with its spider-like lower half, has spinnerets out of
                     which it can unspool silk at a rate of 2m/sec, creating a web over the course
                     of anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Tactics</h4>
                    As stated previously, Vampyre Lords almost never leave their lairs, preferring instead
                     to have their various Spawns enact their will on the Central Plane, and relying on the
                     webs and arachnid inhabitants of their lairs to protect them from any would-be intruders.
                     One of the few things that will get a Lord to leave their lair is the slaughter of all of
                     their Spawns; though a Lord will have back-up victims ready to convert should such an
                     occurrence come to pass, they will eventually run out and will have to acquire more if
                     their Spawns continue to be slain. Should the Lord get into a fight, they are more than
                     capable fighters, using their multiple sets of claws, powerful teeth, flight, spider 
                     allies, and not least of all their Aether to readily and handily subdue their foes, either
                     from a distance or up close. They prefer not to wear armor under any circumstances, instead
                     relying on their defensive reflexes and naturally tough hide to defend themselves.
