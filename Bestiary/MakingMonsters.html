            <h2>Letting Creativity Flow</h2>
            <p>There are a great, great many monsters and creatures presented in this book that
             players are free to use and place into their campaigns as they wish. But what if you 
             have an idea for a monster that isn’t presented here? The solution to this is simple:
             just make a stat block for it yourself! Presented here is a step-by-step method of 
             creating your own creatures in manner akin to those presented here.</p>
             
            <br>
            
            <h2>Step 0: Modify an Existing Creature</h2>
            <p>Before dedicating the time and energy necessary to making a creature of your own,
             try to find an existing creature already in this book that is similar to the one you 
             have an idea for, and modify it (in lore, mechanics, or both) to suit your idea. This 
             may prove more fruitful than you think!</p>
             
            <h2>Step 1: What is its Name?</h2>
            <p>Every great monster needs a name. Think of a name that properly captures the 
             beast’s essence, its gravitas, the terror (or otherwise) that it should strike in all 
             those that hear it.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 2: How Difficult is It?</h2>
            <p>A very important early step is how difficult your monster is, vis-à-vis its Tier. There are
             7 Tiers of difficulty in I&A, numbered 0 - 6. A creature's difficulty directly influences its
             defenses, Health, the damage it deals, and its abilities. A monster of a given Tier is designed
             to be faced by 4 PCs of varying classes with no special equipment, but does not account for that
             monster's tactics or tendency to fight in a group; for example, a single wolf is a Tier 0 
             creature, however a group of 1d6+2 wolves would be a suitable encounter for a group of Tier 1
             PCs.</p>
            <p>The Tiers are as follows:</p>
            <table>
                <caption><b>Tiers</b></caption>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tier</th>
                    <th>Level Range</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0 - 1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1 - 4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>5 - 8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>9 - 12</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>13 - 16</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>17 - 20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>20+</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
             
            <h2>Step 3: What Type of Creature is It?</h2>
            <p>Is this creature a <a href="./Monstrosities.html">Monstrosity</a>,
             <a href="./Beasts.html">Beast</a>, <a href="./Undead.html">Undead</a>, an
             <a href="./Others.html">Other</a>, or something else entirely? Knowing what type of
             creature your monster is is important to knowing its niche in the world and under
             what circumstances your players can/should encounter it.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 4: How Big is It?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s size is important for a multitude of factors. A creature’s size will
             inform you of its Health, its defenses, how much damage it should deal, and the scale of
             its threat.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 5: What are its Ability Scores?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s ability scores convey a great deal of information about it, primarily
             what it is good at and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Additionally, its ability
             scores will inform its defenses and saves. The highest any creature’s ability scores can
             go is 10, though there are exceptions for creatures such as gods and Titans.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 6: How Good are its Defenses, and Does it Have any Weaknesses?</h2>
            <p>The next step is determining the creature’s (Ra)DEF scores and its saves; these should largely
             be determined by its Tier, especially its (Ra)DEF. Assuming it is wearing Light, Medium, or no
             Armor, its Dodge score is determined by its 
             <a href="../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter8.html">Size Penalty</a> + its DEX score + its AGI score
             (minimum 0). Its Armor, on the other hand, can be decided arbitrarily depending on the creature's
             Dodge and Tier. Keep in mind that, using the standard model of Weapon Proficiency advancement
             (i.e. under typical circumstances), PCs can only output so much damage with a given attack, so
             a foe's (Ra)DEF needs to exist within a range that the PCs can reasonably surpass at least 
             sometimes. To this end, a creature's Armor score can make up for any shortcomings left by
             its Dodge score. While this will typically be done by the creature's natural armor, a good way
             to make a lower-Tier monster more of a challenge for higher-level characters would be to
             supply it with <a href="../Rulebook/Part5/Chapter3.html">artificial armor</a>.</p>
            <p>Use this table as a guide when deciding what the final (Ra)DEF score of a creature you are
             designing be.</p>
            <table>
                <caption><b>(Ra)DEF Score by Tier</b></caption>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tier</th>
                    <th>(Ra)DEF Range</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>4 - 8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>8 - 12</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>26 - 32</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>34 - 40</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>40+</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <!--<p>A creature may also have a <b>Weakness</b>, which is a part of its body that is
             less well-protected than the rest of it, such as a soft underbelly or the flesh underneath
             its scales. The (Ra)DEF of a creature's Weakness(es) should be considerably lower than the rest
             of its body, and all a player has to do to target a foe's Weakness is specify that that's what
             they're targeting. To prevent making encounters against monsters that have Weaknesses too easy,
             they should not be made immediately known to the PCs, requiring either foreknowledge of the
             Weakness (which could be gained through research or some other means) or by passing some sort
             of skill check, such as Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Survival.</p>-->
            <p>A creature's <a href="../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter6.html">saves</a> are determined by its
             ability scores: Fortitude is its STR + CON divided by 2; Reflex is the creature’s AGI + DEX
             divided by 2; Willpower is comprised of the creature's CHA + either its INT or WIS divided by 2.
             Each save has a bonus equal to the larger of the two scores that make up the save.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 7: How Much Health Does it Have?</h2>
            <p>The size of a creature’s Health Die is determined by its Size, while the amount of Health
             it has should largely by determined by its Tier and whether it prefers to fight alone or in
             a group.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Size</th>
                    <th>Health Die (Average)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tiny</td>
                    <td>d2 (1.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Small</td>
                    <td>d4 (2.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Medium</td>
                    <td>d6 (3.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Big</td>
                    <td>d8 (4.5)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Large</td>
                    <td>d10 (5.5)</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Massive and Colossal</td>
                    <td>d20 (10.5)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>As for determining exactly how much Health a creature has, that is up
             to you to decide, and is ultimately a big factor in how difficult you want the monster 
             to be/how long you want the fight to be, i.e. monsters with more Health will be more
             difficult and make for longer fights. Also, don’t forget to multiply its CON score by the number
             of Health Dice used and add that to its average Health, e.g. a creature with a CON score of 2
             and 5 Health Dice will have 10 (2 times 5) added to its average Health. If you want to
             vary a creature’s Health without rolling all of its Health Dice, consider rolling a 
             single Health Die and adding or subtracting that to its average Health depending on 
             whether the result is odd or even, respectively.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 8: What is it Vulnerable/Resistant/Immune To?</h2>
            <p>Depending on a creature’s nature, it may be vulnerable, resistant, or immune to 
             certain damage types or conditions, e.g. Scorched will be immune to burn damage but
             vulnerable to freeze damage, and snakes cannot be knocked prone.</p>
            <p>If a creature is vulnerable or resistant to any conditions, then it has
             disadvantage or advantage respectively on saves against those conditions.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 9: How Fast is It?</h2>
            <p>A creature’s speed is largely determined by its size, but is also modified by its
             AGI score and general body shape: for example, Tiny creatures are able to cover a lot 
             less ground than Large ones, and quadrupeds are much quicker than bipeds. If a creature
             is a quadruped, add 2m/sec to its speed; aside from that, refer to the following table for 
             determining a creature’s speed – remember a creature’s Base Speed refers to its speed when its
             AGI score is 0. For every .5 above 0 that a creature's AGI score increases, their Movement increases by .25m/sec.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Size</th>
                    <th>Base Speed</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tiny</td>
                    <td>.5m/sec</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Small</td>
                    <td>1.5m/sec</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>Large</td>
                    <td>3m/sec</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Huge</td>
                    <td>3.5m/sec</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Massive</td>
                    <td>4m/sec</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Colossal</td>
                    <td>5m/sec</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Also remember that a creature may be more at home in the water or in 
             the air than on land, in which case the above table applies to their swimming/flying 
             speed rather than their walking speed.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 10: What Skills Does it Have?</h2>
            <p>This step is rather straightforward: whatever you believe your creature is good
             at, give it the appropriate proficiency in the appropriate skill, e.g. a land-based
             creature that is good at swimming should have a Swim proficiency of <u>></u>3.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 11: Does it Have any Special Senses?</h2>
            <p>Some creatures, particularly nocturnal ones or those that have lived in the dark
             for extended periods of time, will develop special senses to help them survive in their
             environment, or they may have these senses as a result of arcane influence: senses like
             infrared vision, blindsense, or something else entirely.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 12: What Language(s) Does it Speak?</h2>
            <p>Many creatures and monsters are able to speak, either physically or 
             telepathically. If your creature can speak, consider what languages it does know,
             or if other creatures simply interpret what it “says” as a language they already 
             know, such as in the case of some of the Others. Remember that Common is a language
             that a creature must be taught.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 13: Where can it be Found?</h2>
            <p>Determined in large part by what type of creature it is – but ultimately by you –
             where a creature is found either in general or by your party specifically is a very 
             important aspect of that creature’s existence; <a href="./Unliving.html">Unliving</a>,
             for example, are almost solely found on the Plane of Life.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 14: Does it Have Passive Abilities?</h2>
            <p>Some creatures have abilities that do not require time to use or are simply
             always active. One such example of this is the Shark’s Bloodlust feature, which 
             activates immediately upon the Shark tasting blood or dealing final damage to a creature.
             A creature’s passive abilities can heavily impact its difficulty.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 15: What are its Attacks, and How Much do They Hurt?</h2>
            <p>For their attacks, most creatures will likely use their natural weapons, such as
             their claws or teeth. As a creature gets larger, the value of its damage die will 
             generally increase - as shown in the table below - but this is not a hard-and-fast
             rule, as creatures may have varying weapons that deal different amounts of damage
             and bestow different effects. When determining how much damage a creature deals, keep the 
             party’s defenses in mind: most DEF scores start at around 5-10 and increase as PCs gain levels.</p>

            <h2>Step 16: Does it Have Active Abilities?</h2>
            <p>Aside from a creature’s attacks, it is important to consider whether it has any
             other abilities, such as innate elemancy, shapeshifting, or anything else of note.
             All creatures also have access to the actions listed
             <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter1.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Creatures that have innate abilities (like breath weapons or the Griffin's <b>Wing Beat</b>
             ability) have areas of effect like spells, but the point of origin is always the monster 
             themselves.</p>
             
            <h2>Step 17: What Does it Have on It?</h2>
            <p>Many creatures will have loot on their person, which they usually lose possession
             of when they die or are otherwise defeated. Additionally, many monsters and creatures 
             can have their hides or scales harvested to make armor, or have their organs harvested
             for Alchemy Ingredients - use this table as a guide. If a creature has more than one type
             of natural armor, then the amount of armor materials that can be harvested is split evenly 
             between the two, e.g. a Massive monster that has both Beast Hide and Monster Scale can
             have up to 25 lbs. of each harvested from its body. The types of Alchemy Ingredients that can
             be harvested depends largely on the nature of the monster, e.g. a monster with poisonous attacks
             would give Poison Ingredients, but other attack types like fire or ice might give Elixir or
             Ether Ingredients; additionally, Alchemy Ingredients adhere to the same "split evenly" rules
             as armor materials.</p>
            <p>Both armor materials and Alchemy Ingredients can be gathered via a Medicine or Survival check,
             however, when harvesting Alchemy Ingredients, you can add your Alchemy Supplies proficiency to the
             roll in addition to your INT/WIS score. Remember that this table
             is just a suggestion and does not need to be strictly adhered to.</p>
